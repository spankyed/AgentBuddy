// A pack's surface runs under `<packId>/<featureId>`, so this pack's `notes` feature and
// default-setup's are two surfaces with two addresses, not one shadowing the other. Before that, the
// second pack to register a `notes` surface was dropped into the renderer console: it installed
// "successfully" with no UI, and every send to `notes` reached whichever pack registered first.
//
// **So this fixture's feature is named after a real default-setup one deliberately, and must stay.**
// Everywhere else a fictional feature takes a name no pack has (`memos`, `calendar`), because
// `features/notes` otherwise names an invention and a real feature at once. Here the collision is the
// subject: rename it and the suite still passes, over two addresses that were never going to clash.
