// The claim the attach design rests on: a page that arrived over CDP answers a verb the same as a page a
// launch handed back, so one `SessionPage` serves both and `drive` stops needing to own the app it drives.
//
// It earns a place here on the two counts this directory asks for (root `CLAUDE.md`, "E2E visual testing"):
// it needs the real process boundary — two Playwright connections to one Electron over a real debug port,
// which no harness has — and a future change could break it, since the whole of `drive` moves onto the
// attached path.
//
// **Which window the attach path picks is not asserted here**, and cannot usefully be: `pages()[0]` is the
// right one in this app today, so this spec passes with the predicate replaced by "take the first" —
// measured, by doing that. The choice among targets is held by `apack-testing`'s `cdp-page.spec.ts`
// against a fake that presents several on purpose.
//
// **It launches its own app rather than using the fixture, and must.** `appLaunchEnv` sets
// `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST=true`, so a fixture-launched app resolves the `test` environment, and the debug port is
// `development` only. So this is the one spec here that drives `_electron.launch` directly, with its own
// temp data dir.
