/**
 * **An attachable app is one that published a session, and a test app publishes none** — though it is
 * running with a debug port wide open, which is the fact that makes this worth a case.
 *
 * Playwright drives Electron over CDP, so it launches every app here with `--remote-debugging-port`, and
 * Chromium writes the number it chose to `DevToolsActivePort` in the data dir. So a tool that *inferred*
 * attachability — from the file, from a reachable port — would find this app and drive a test run's app
 * mid-suite. `@apack/host/dev-session`'s rule is that the file is declared instead: `apack dev` and the
 * `npm start` loop publish one because they mean their app to be driven, and nothing treats the absence of
 * one as "try anyway".
 *
 * That was an argument until this case. The port being asserted *present* is what stops the absence below
 * from being read off an empty or wrong directory — and is the same half of the claim, since it is what
 * there would be to infer from.
