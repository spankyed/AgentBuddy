# The half of the external-pack check that needs no app: validate each fixture pack, build it, typecheck it
# against its generated facades, and run its harness specs. The same path a third-party pack author takes.
#
# Its own file rather than a flag on one script, and that is not style. `check:tiers` reads a step's scripts
# as text to find out whether it can reach the app, and a branch it never takes still reads as a reach — so a
# `--contract` mode inside the script that also runs `abuddy test` defeats the check meant to keep the halves
# apart. Two files make the dependency structural (docs/goals/goal-test-tiers.md).
#
# Proved by running this with packages/renderer/dist moved aside: 32 tests, exit 0, no app.
