Current working goal:

Polish the existing Remotion launch film into a professional AgentBuddy demo by reviewing the rendered video in motion, fixing visible fidelity and pacing issues as they appear, and keeping every UI surface grounded in near-1:1 replicas of the real Vue app. Prioritize concrete improvements over broad audits: when a section looks wrong, patch the component/state/timing that causes it, render again, and continue through the film.

Non-negotiables:
- Use real Remotion-driven sequencing and motion, not Electron/Playwright screenshots.
- Keep UI components split into source-mirrored files, not giant one-off shot files.
- Do not add fake/ad-hoc plugin UIs, loading indicators, chrome, or decorative filler that does not exist in the app.
- Each chapter should reveal progressively: start with one or two focused components, then expand to the full app surface when the story earns it.
- The montage should show real AgentBuddy surfaces and pay off prior actions, not random feature tiles.
- The final screen should be plain black with `clientlabs.com` and `June 19th`.

intro: AgentBuddy is:

\-- 1

More than just an AI chat
- initially just show the chat input
  - progressively show and click `+ new thread` button
  - progressively show the rest of the chat area (small) - sliding in from the top - chat input slides down
  - type a prompt, reference a note and paste an image
  - press send
- click recent threads area
  - open a thread that just completed
    - progressively slide in the messages quickly 1 by 1
  - mouse over and click quick prompts menu than send a quick prompt message - "write a commit"
- focus and click the thread title under chat input to open dashboard tabs
  - ok to progressively show entire app layout at this point, should have enough pieces to where it isnt jarring switching to threads dashboard
  - the new thread created in the previous scene should show a plan artifact
  - pin the new thread
- click new thread button in the thread plugin canvas header row
  - type in instructions, than a title - for another new thread create form
  - link to a parent ticket/thread through the UI
  - click the create button
  - than click the kanban view button
  - move newly create thread into the 'in-progress' board on the kanban view
    - claude-code tag shows on the thread
- end of scene

\-- 2

More than just a note taker
- show recent notes or notes home state UI initially
- click a note card to open a note
- edit note text and add an image - than resize the image through bubble menu
- now can "progressively slide in" notes side panel: click to open a tasklist in the notes side panel
  - mark another todo as completed
  - create a todo
    - add a pill link to the thread created in the previous chapter with #threads: \[thread\]
- end of scene

\-- 3

More than just an IDE
- show the right side panel with the directory / project select UI initially
- type out a commit message "incomplete work"
  - stash staged code
- checkout a worktree through the worktree UI in the commits feature panel
- now "progressively slide in" canvas/editor to the left of the code plugin right side panel: review unstaged code from worktree
  - stage the unstaged code
  - click generate commit message button
  - click commit button
- open terminal to start app
  - open an app/ fake app that just shows a page that says "anti-gravity" sucks
- than click the publish (now showing in place of the commit button)
  - switch over to the PR panel
  - and create a PR
  - merge the PR

\-- 4

More than just a workflow engine

- show a listener step for `user.command` only initially. than progressively show:
  - attach a switch step and have a condition branch for is `/replace-obsolete-apps`
  - add a step for "finding and deleting all obselete apps"
  - show the form to edit the step
    - write code to find apps:
      - anti-gravity, cursor, vscode
      - notion, obsidian, tick-tick
    - add a log for "all obsolete apps removed" - will show the result/log briefly in the next chapter

\-- 5

AgentBuddy is a revolution to put the full power of AI into the hands of the people
- no progress showing necessary - show full app to quickly go between scenes - its ok to somewhat overwhelm the user here - we've warmed them up and now want to go quick fire through more things they can expect.
- type /replace-obsolete-apps in the chat input, and pressing enter
- check log plugin for logs for "all obsolete apps removed'
- query for something in the database plugin
  - be creative here - I'm running out ideas - something coherent to the story being told
- checking for brain plugin
  - check trace and out for /replace-obsolete-apps execution
- open settings to provider settings

outro: Clientlabs.com, june 19th
