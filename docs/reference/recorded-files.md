# Recorded recorded files: derivations, proxies and samples

Why this is a reference and not a rule: the rule is three sentences and lives in the root `CLAUDE.md`. What
is here is the evidence for it — two subsystems that were built, measured and deleted, and what each cost
while it lived. Read it before adding a recorded file, or when you are about to argue that a proxy or a
sample is worth it after all.

The archived goals hold the same ground from the other direction:
[`goal-placement-without-a-clock.md`](../archive/goals/goal-placement-without-a-clock.md) is the attempt that
ended the sample, and [`goal-measured-placement.md`](../archive/goals/goal-measured-placement.md) is the one
that built it.

**Current facade check (2026-10-18):** the root chain now uses explicit `--from-build`. Its producer
seals input observations and output together; the check verifies that receipt and replays source and
dependency freshness before comparing the published facade. This replaces the unchecked `dist` read
criticized below and avoids regeneration beside build consumers. Standalone source derivation remains
the pack-local default. The measurements and ordering discussion below describe the earlier implementation.

**Three kinds of recorded file, and the question to ask of a new one is which it is.**

A **derivation** re-takes its answer on every run and compares — `schema:check`, `exports:check`,
`facade:check`, `content-parity:check`. A missing input is not a thing that can happen to one, so a case
perturbing the recorded file would only prove that `!==` works.

**Re-taking the answer means running whatever produces it, and that is the half a derivation loses
quietly.** `facade:check` compared the committed report against `dist/types/pack-types.d.ts` — a file some
earlier `apack pack build` wrote, from whatever the sources were then — so `npm run build:default-setup` was right by
ordering alone and the same command run by hand could pass over a bundle an hour old, while `--update` wrote
a committed file off it.

**Re-taking it also bought back the ordering, which is the part that took a second change to collect.** Once
the check bundled the facade itself, being appended to `build:default-setup` was 2.7s of a second bundle in series —
`bundlePackTypes` twice per run, the build's into `dist` and the check's into a temp dir. It is its own chain
step now, declaring what it reads: the graph orders it after `build:default-setup` because it reads the barrel `build:default-setup`
writes, so the ordering that used to be spelled with `&&` is derived from the same declaration that makes its
own regenerate a no-op. Measured 2026-10-07: `build:default-setup` 26.3s before, the check 2.7s of it. What it costs not to do that is one bundle: re-bundling default-setup's facade is
2.4s (median of 3, 86% idle, 2026-10-06) and reproduces the build's output byte for byte, against `api:check`
at 6.9s for the same shape. A check whose subject is a file it did not produce is a derivation in name only.

A **proxy** records a hash of what it *believes* the inputs are. **Nothing here is one any more**, and the
one that was is why: a proxy's key is a list of someone else's inputs, so it can go stale from an input
nobody listed, and its remedy *writes*. `api:stamp` was a proxy for `api:check` purely because that cost
55s; at 6.9s the derivation is the cheaper thing to keep. Before reaching for one, price the derivation
again — the paragraph above has what this one cost.

A **sample** records a measurement, which cannot re-derive, so neither check is available to it. **There
are none left, and the one there was is the most expensive lesson in this section.** `spec-cost.json`
recorded what every spec cost in milliseconds, so that a gate could move a file between the fast and
integration halves. It was deleted on 2026-10-05, and what it cost to keep is the thing to read before
adding another sample:

- Treated as a derivation it churned — measured 2026-09-28, **125 of 163 entries changed between two runs on
  an idle machine** while the answer it supported changed zero times. So it needed hysteresis on the record,
  a band rather than equality for its check, and a refusal to record a run that had moved too much to have
  been measuring the code.
- Those three were not enough, because hysteresis says nothing about *which* reading became the answer: the
  first one in won, and for a crossing it won outright. Measured 2026-10-03, a recording at 78% idle moved
  two specs across the upper edge and the gate demanded two renames nobody had earned; the same band then
  stopped two clean runs correcting it, since displacing a value takes 35% of it. So it grew a **window** of
  readings whose median was the answer — one reading kept but unable to decide, two that agree able to.
- A millisecond is a fact about a machine, so it also needed a `machine` field, a path for a record measured
  on another box, and an idle floor on recording.
- And a sum of it needed a drift report, because a correlated slowdown sits under every per-spec tolerance.
  That report fired on one file's noise in five of the twelve records, where a single spec was 64% or more of
  the body (`@apackdev/ui` 93%, `main` 89%, `@apackdev/sdk` 86%) and the worst single spec moves 74% between two
  quiet runs.

**What finally settled it was not the cost of the apparatus but a contradiction.** Once each spec was
measured in the pool that actually runs it, one read 2.8s in the fast half and 0.64s in the integration
half — 4.37x apart, against a band of 2.5x. It was over the upper edge in one half and under the lower edge
in the other, so a gate acting on either reading demanded a move the other reading demanded back. The
quantity was never one number, and no amount of hysteresis fixes that.

So the half is a decision now, declared by a filename, and nothing re-derives it
(`scripts/lib/spec-halves.ts`). Slowness is reported where it happens rather than adjudicated against a
record, in three places: vitest prints any test over its 300ms `slowTestThreshold` under its file, the
chain prints each step's five slowest tests (`slow-tests.ts`), and each unit pool prints its five slowest
*files* per half, ranked, which is the one thing vitest's output does not give
(`scripts/lib/spec-durations.ts`), **with each half's total beside it**, since a ranking says what is worst
and never whether a half is getting heavy — measured, the five slowest hold 46% of one suite's fast half and
97% of another's. Both reach `npm run chain` and `npm run test:unit`, which buffer a step's output and print
it only on failure: until that was wired the pools printed a ranking nobody running either command saw.
A spec may say in its header why it is slow — `// @slow: <reason>` — and
the pool holds that marker to still being true: a marked spec that is no longer in its half's slow tail
fails the step, quoting the reason, so the remedy is to drop the marker. **Only that direction is a gate.**
Load inflates a duration — 1.27x median, 3.29x at worst — so it can hide a stale marker and cannot invent
one; an *unmarked* spec that reads slow is therefore reported and never failed. The bar is the half's p90
from the same run, so a slow run moves the file and the bar together, which is what a fixed millisecond
could not do: measured, it left two of the five markers 13% clear of a 2,500ms edge and 5.2x clear of this
one.

**"Load cannot invent one" is true of the file's time and was never true of the bar**, which is that same
p90 — so what the gate also needs is a population the marked file belongs to. A pool runs the projects whose
inputs moved, so most runs are partial, and a marked spec at a constant duration is above or below a partial
run's bar depending on which projects ran beside it: measured 2026-10-06 by holding one at 2,900ms and
changing only its neighbours, it was stale against a bar of 7,000ms in an 11-file run and 5,600ms in a
31-file run, having not moved. So `placementOf` takes `whole` and checks no marker without it, reporting the
half as unchecked the way it already did for one too small to have a tail. It was unreachable when found —
only four files are slower than the slowest marked one and each sits in a project of 61 to 100 files, so two
slow files can never be a tenth of a run — and that is arithmetic about this suite rather than anything the
code held, which is the kind of safety worth replacing rather than recording. **The lesson for a future sample: price the apparatus against the decision it informs.** 1,884 lines, twelve records, two idle floors and a machine identity decided which of
two config files a spec was listed in, where nine of twelve packages had only one config to begin with.

**And the successor carries a deletion condition from the start, which is the part this lesson was missing.**
`spec-cost.json` accumulated one only in hindsight. The `@slow:` marker gate — `SLOW_QUANTILE`, `tailBar`,
`slowReason`, `markedSpecs`, `placementOf`, the outlier detector and their six describes, about 550 of the
1,901 lines across `spec-durations.ts`, its reporter and their specs, plus 115 in `unit-pool.ts` and its
spec where the report is printed — guards fourteen annotations in one direction, and its failure
mode is a stale comment. What it is *for* is whether a spec should move between halves.

**The wait was answered, and in the direction the condition did not expect.** `f2a003bb2` moved two specs
on this evidence on 2026-10-06: `fe-bundler-proxy-exports` into `@apackdev/cli`'s integration half, and
`published-manifest-paths` against a recorded placement whose justifying figure had gone 2.5x stale. So the
condition as written — a year passing with nothing moved — cannot be the test any more, and the question is
no longer whether the gate is ever acted on.

**What the count still says is how much of the population is reachable.** Eleven of the fourteen sit in
packages with a single vitest config, so for those the move the remedy names costs a new config and a root
project entry rather than a rename — `hasSplit` is where that fact lives, and `markerReachLines` prints the
gap on a passing run. The three in `@apackdev/cli` have both halves and could move today. So what would now
justify deleting the gate and keeping the ranking is a settled judgement that keeping these markers true is
not worth its weight, priced against the two placement decisions it has enabled — a judgement rather than
something a run can check, which is why it is prose. The mechanical halves stay cases: that the markers
have not collapsed to none, in `markedSpecs`' describe, and how many could move, in `poolDurationLines`'.

**And the reported half was computed where no passing run could print it**, which is the defect that found
all of the above. `placementOf`'s unmarked list was written only to the pool's own stdout, and both callers
buffer a step's output and print it on failure alone — so the direction deliberately left as a report was
visible only when something else broke, which is the one shape the four ways of saying a result is partial
forbid. It is a line on the pass path now, naming the files rather than counting them, because the ranking
beside it is ordered by cost and that list by test time, so an unmarked file in the tail need not be among
the rows a reader can see. On the first run it printed, the integration half's two slowest files — 41.3s and
31.5s — were both unmarked.

**One window came back, and it is worth saying why it is not a sample in the fatal sense.** The duration
cache (`scripts/lib/spec-durations.ts`) keeps ten readings per suite and half. It is uncommitted, it cannot
leave the machine that wrote it, and **nothing compares it against an edge** — its whole output is one
`(was Xs over N runs)` column on the five slowest files a pool already prints. That is the distinction to
carry: what made `spec-cost.json` cost 1,884 lines was not keeping readings, it was *deciding* with them.
A record that informs a column needs no hysteresis, no band, no tie rule, no machine field and no idle
floor, because there is no threshold for a reading to be wrong about. The file count does not grow either,
so the prune still answers for every name in the directory.

**The chain's `seconds` table was the sample-shaped thing that remained, and it is a declaration now.** Its
recorder had the full apparatus — a half-to-double band, a one-second floor, a machine field, a budget check,
an 80% idle floor sampled after the run, a body-versus-member drift verdict, and five flags to work around
them — and the quantity underneath was still not one number: `test:smoke` read 11s, 16s, 20s, 21s and 24s
across five runs that all passed that floor, because `seconds` is the cost *beside whichever peers the
schedule admitted*, and no floor can see the schedule. None of its readers gated a merge on it, so none of
them ever needed the number to be fresh.

**Then the declaration went too.** Once a deadline was a declared class and the stretch projection was gone,
nothing that decides pass or fail read a step's cost, so a hand-written figure policed by a drift report
was apparatus for a column. What a step costs is now a reading — a machine-local window of recent passing
runs (`scripts/lib/step-durations.ts`), the same shape as the spec duration cache above — and the critical
path and a failure report read its median. **Keep the reading; do not decide with it** is the rule, and this
is the third subsystem it has now cost.


## The recorded-file checks

The root `CLAUDE.md`'s argument for derivations over proxies and samples, and for `api:check` and
`packages:check` being chain steps, in full.

**`api:check` is a chain step and needs no proxy.** It regenerates the reviewed reports and compares, so it is
a derivation and has no staleness record of its own to go stale. It costs **6.9s** — median of 5, 6.7-7.0s,
measured 2026-10-05 — which is less than `typecheck:pack`, so there is nothing a cheaper stand-in would buy.
Two things keep it there: one API Extractor compiler state per package rather than one per entry, and the
three packages' extractions running at once rather than in the series `npm -w a -w b -w c` gives.

**Do not add a proxy for it, and these are the five reasons.** A hash of the declarations a report is a
function of is the obvious cheap stand-in, and every one of its failure modes is worse than the 6.9s:
a doc-comment edit reddens it though no report can move; a package's stamp fingerprints its *dependencies'*
declarations, so clearing sdk's leaves ui's red and one comment costs two round trips; every fix writes a
committed file, including runs that change no report; it cannot see a hand-edited `etc/*.api.md` whose
declarations never moved, which a derivation simply reads as an input. And it races a rebuild in flight —
more than one process touching this tree is the ordinary case — which matters because **the remedy a proxy
names is a write.** `api:update` run inside that window records a hash of a half-written tree into a
committed file and looks like it worked. A derivation cannot: it compares and writes nothing, so a racing
read fails and the next run passes.

**`packages:check` is a chain step, for the opposite reason**: publint and attw over the five published trees
cost seconds together, so there is nothing to build a proxy for, and
its only other homes were the publish workflow
and a CI file whose triggers are commented out — the recorded-file checks ran at the one moment they cannot be
cheap. **It takes no mutex, and that is a thing it had to stop needing**: `attw --pack <dir>` packs a tarball
inside the tree it is checking, which made it a second writer of trees twenty-nine other steps read, so it ran
alone — 6s of a cold run for a tool that takes a tarball path. `scripts/packages-check.ts` packs outside the
repository instead (`packTree`), and derives both populations from `publishedTreeDirs()`: publint over all five
tarballs, attw over the four whose tree ships declarations. Both read the same tarball per tree — publint's
other mode asks `npm pack --dry-run` for the file list, which is a subprocess for an answer already inside the
tarball (0.4s against 0.1s, interleaved, paired over 5 at 83% idle, 2026-10-08), and the same rules run either
way: both of publint's input kinds converge on one `core()` with a different virtual filesystem. It is not the
dangling-published-path check, which publint cannot be — it skips any target behind a custom condition, which
is how 99 published paths named files no tarball held. `@app/publish-checks`' `published-manifest-paths` is
that one.
**Three kinds of recorded file, and the question to ask of a new one is which it is.** A
**derivation** re-takes its answer on every run and compares (`schema:check`, `exports:check`,
`facade:check`, `content-parity:check`, `api:check`) — a missing input cannot happen to one. **Re-taking it
means running whatever produces it**, which is the half that is easy to skip: a check that compares against
a file some earlier command left on disk is a derivation in name only, and goes stale exactly as a proxy
does while reading like one that cannot. A **proxy**
records a hash of what it *believes* the inputs are; **nothing here is one any more**, because a proxy can
go stale from an input nobody listed and its remedy *writes*. A **sample** records a measurement, so
neither check is available to it — **there are none, and do not add one.**

**Price the derivation before reaching for either.** `api:stamp` was a proxy for `api:check` purely because
that cost 55s; at 6.9s the derivation is cheaper to keep, and the proxy's whole justification went with the
speedup. And a sample's apparatus outgrows the decision it informs: `spec-cost.json` was 1,884 lines, twelve
records, a band, a window, a tie rule, a machine field and two idle floors, to decide which of two config
files a spec was listed in — a question nine of twelve packages could not even ask. **The quantity was never
one number**, which no amount of hysteresis fixes: one spec read 2.8s in the fast half and 0.64s in the
integration half, 4.37x apart against a band of 2.5x. The half is a decision now, declared by a filename
(`scripts/lib/spec-halves.ts`), and nothing re-derives it.

[`docs/reference/recorded-files.md`](recorded-files.md) has what each of those cost,
measurement by measurement. **There are none left.** What a chain step costs is a reading: a machine-local
window of recent passing runs (`scripts/lib/step-durations.ts`), which orders nothing that decides pass or
fail — it draws the critical path and is the context a failure report gives — so it needs no band, floor or
machine field.
