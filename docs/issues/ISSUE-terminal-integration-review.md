# Issue: Terminal integration — review findings and path forward

**Date:** 2026-10-01
**Status:** Open
**Severity:** Critical — one finding writes user credentials to disk in plaintext; two more can lose work
**Component:** `packages/default-setup/src/features/code` — terminal (xterm.js front end, node-pty back end),
plus the app plumbing it depends on (`packages/main`, `packages/api`, `@abuddy/host/bus`)

## Symptom

The terminal is reported as "super buggy in general, especially in the FE UX", with no reproducible bug list
behind it. This document is that list.

## How this was reviewed

Two rounds.

**Round 1** — four manual passes over the feature's own eight files (2,743 lines): ownership and lifecycle,
the output hot path, process safety, completeness. Produced F1-F17. That round was, by construction, a
static read of one feature, on the happy path, on macOS, in one window.

**Round 2** — six parallel reviews against falsifiable hypotheses, each covering an axis round 1 could not
see, plus a git-history pass. Produced S, M, X, T, L and G below, **corrected two round-1 findings**, and
returned several useful negative results.

Still not done: **nothing here was measured at runtime.** F3, F4, F5 and G1 are severity claims derived from
reading code. See Stage 0.

---

## Corrections to round 1

**F1 was wrong about reachability, and the correction matters.** I claimed that opening one terminal in a
canvas tab *and* the panel leaves one blank, because the pool holds a single DOM wrapper. In a single window
that is **not reachable**: `fe/features/terminal/PanelTerminalSection.vue:110` makes a tabbed terminal
unclickable in the panel list, `:148` and `:156` offer "Open in Tab" / "Move back here" mutually exclusively
on `isInTab`, `fe/state.ts:864` repoints `panelTerminalId` away on `openTerminalInTab` (and explicitly does
`tabbedIds.add(ev.terminalId)` to compensate for the stale context), and the canvas mounts a terminal only
when its tab is active. The move paths were traced in both directions and are safe — detach precedes attach
in every case, by Vue's queue phases.

What survives of F1 is narrower and still worth fixing: **`terminalPool.detach(id)` never checks that the
caller owns the attachment** (`fe/utils/terminal-pool.ts:260-272`), so this correctness rests on Vue's flush
ordering rather than on an invariant the pool enforces. And the blank *is* reachable with a second window —
see M3. So F1 is reclassified: **Low as a single-window defect, High as a structural fragility that M3
converts into a real one.**

**What that unreachability is not: evidence of a design.** Exclusivity here is emergent, not stated. There is
no comment, contract or spec asserting it anywhere in the feature. `isInTab` is a one-line computed over tab
paths (`PanelTerminalSection.vue:255-256`) used five times in a template — to grey a row, to append "(in
tab)" to a tooltip, to no-op a click, and to swap a context-menu item. Those are display concerns, and the
tooltip says what the helper was written for; the invariant is a side effect. The tell is `fe/state.ts:864`,
whose `tabbedIds.add(ev.terminalId)` hand-patches exactly the stale-`context` bug that **T1 reports as
unfixed** in a sibling handler: one site noticed, the other did not. And the enforcement already has a hole —
**M3 is a path that forgot the rule**, producing the two-hosts-one-node state through a broadcast reply. So
the behaviour is accretion that happens to compose, and it carries no weight as precedent.

**F14 is sharper than stated.** Shell integration is not merely off by default: there is exactly one line
ever written for `enableShellIntegration` (`+ enableShellIntegration: false,`), so the subsystem behind it
— `injectShellIntegration`'s three shell branches, the OSC 7/633/1337 parsing, `updateCwd`, `CWD_CHANGED`
— has in all likelihood **never executed for any user**. The title is set once at creation from
`path.basename(cwd)` (`be/services/terminal.ts:80`) and never follows `cd` for anyone. A default that looks
defensive is simply unfinished. X4 adds that on Windows it does nothing even when switched on.

### S2 — keystrokes on disk (verified against the live log)

The chain, each link read: `terminal-pool.ts:227` `term.onData(sendInput)` fires per keystroke →
`fe/features/terminal/state.ts:78` forwards `terminal.TERMINAL_INPUT { terminalId, data }` over
`sendToSystem`, so it goes through the API's `bus.send` → `abuddy-host/src/bus/client-events.ts:54` logs
`{ …, event: summarizeEventForLog(event) }` → `client-events.ts:19-34` shortens **arrays** over 5 items, so
a string payload passes through whole → `api/src/adapters/logging.ts:37` prints it →
`main/.../process-manager.ts:45` → `main/.../logger.ts:55,84` writes `main.log` **and** `main.jsonl`.

Measured on this machine, 2026-10-01: **3,074** `TERMINAL_INPUT` records in `main.log` and **159,014** in
the last 200 MB of `main.jsonl`.

`onData` fires on key presses regardless of terminal echo, so a passphrase typed at `sudo`, `ssh`, GPG or
`npm login` — never shown on screen — is on disk in cleartext. `logger.ts:73` redacts only key-shaped
strings the process already knows. It went unnoticed because the Logs plugin hides the `app-events` source
by default (`features/logs/settings.ts`, `showAppEvents: false`); the UI hides it, the file does not. These
are long-lived files that the app's own "open log file" IPC exposes and that users attach to bug reports.

A deny-list of event names will rot the way S1's env deny-list did. The default for a payload at that seam
must be "not logged".

### S1 — the app's control plane in every shell's environment

`sanitizeEnvironment` is `{...process.env}` minus six names (`be/services/terminal.ts:38-45`), applied on
both spawn paths (`:85`, `:376`). The env it copies is the one Electron main built for the API process,
which sets `ABUDDY_API_TOKEN` (`main/src/modules/api-server/config.ts:100`) along with `API_PORT`,
`ABUDDY_USER_DATA_DIR`, `AGENTBUDDY_LOG_DIR` and `BUILT_IN_PACKS_DIR`. None is on the deny-list.

What the token buys is wider than a secrets read — `secrets.*` returns metadata only
(`api/src/transport/secrets.ts:14-43`), correcting the original hypothesis. The escalation is `bus.send`:
the Database system accepts `EXECUTE_TRANSACTION { code }` (`features/database/be/types.ts:46`), run through
`new Function` with no isolation (`abuddy-sdk/src/database-console/index.ts:104-111`) **inside the API
process** — the process holding the decrypted secrets data key. `bus.sub` streams results back.

Severity is higher in the shipped app, not lower: `apiTokenFile` is written only in development or when the
API invented its own token (`api/src/transport/websocket.ts:120-125`), so in a packaged build the pty env is
the only path. A postinstall hook in any dependency installed from that terminal inherits it without looking.

The fix is an **allow-list** (PATH, HOME, LANG, TERM, shell vars), not a deny-list, plus a spec asserting no
app-owned variable appears in a spawned pty's env — the absence of that test is why the deny-list went stale.

### S3 — a stored string treated as an executable

`be/services/terminal.ts:379-385` spawns `persistedTerminal.shell` with `cwd: persistedTerminal.cwd`.
`validateShell` (`:276`) and `validateCwd` (`:292`) run only on the create path. `restoreTerminals` defaults
to `true`, so this runs at every boot. Writes to a Terminal row therefore become an executable launched at
next start, and such writes exist: the database console's `EXECUTE_TRANSACTION`, `abuddy db exec`, and a
backup import, which replaces the LMDB folders wholesale with no row-level validation
(`abuddy-host/src/backup/index.ts:124-137`). "Import a backup someone sent you" is enough.

Ordering: F13 must be settled first, because the allow-list's current fallback is the value it just
rejected, so validating on restore would be inert.

### L2 — active rows grow without bound, and restore is unbounded

Two facts compose. `killAll` disposes `exitDisposable` *before* `pty.kill()`
(`be/services/terminal.ts:232-245`), so the `onExit` callback that calls `markClosed` never fires, and
`killAll` never calls it either — and `killAll` is the clean-shutdown path (`src/features/hooks.ts:12-16`).
**So every terminal open at a clean quit stays `active: true` forever.** Meanwhile `restoreAll`'s loop
(`:347-355`) has no count check, and `maxTerminals` counts `this.terminals.size`, not rows.

With `restoreTerminals: true` the two cancel out. With it **off** — a one-click toggle at
`fe/settings.vue:209` — `restoreAll` returns early and nothing ever reads or clears those rows; each run adds
more. Toggle it back on and the next boot spawns one shell per accumulated row, in a loop with **no `await`**,
synchronously on the API's event loop, each feeding F3's accumulator and F6's `localStorage` write.
`maxTerminals` is also read as `?? 0` = no limit, and the settings form offers a one-click "no limit".

This also sharpens **F7**: because `killAll` never clears `active` or the pid, the "kill orphaned process
from previous session (e.g. after a crash)" block runs on **every normal restart**, for every terminal. The
comment understates when the pid-recycling hazard is live.

### T3 — the restore race is narrowed, not closed

The deferral is correct in one direction: `restorePersistedTabs` runs in the machine's `entry`, so
`pendingTerminalTabIds` is set before any backend event arrives. But the fallback is a fixed 2,500 ms timer,
and the backend answers at exactly one reliable moment. `be/features/terminal.ts:302-309` keeps
`REFRESH_LIST`, `CREATE_TERMINAL`, `CLOSE_TERMINAL` and `OPEN_TERMINAL_TAB` in `idle` only, so both front-end
prompts — `initializePlugin`'s `REFRESH_LIST` and `CODE_CONNECTED` — are **dropped** while
`restoreTerminalsActor` is still spawning stored ptys. If `TERMINALS_LISTED` lands after the settle, the
settle has already cleared `pendingTerminalTabIds` *and* called `persistCodeTabs` on an `openFiles` that
never received the terminal tabs — so the tab layout is erased from `localStorage`. The ptys are alive and
listed in the panel; their tabs are gone for good.

Same mechanism: a `terminal.CREATE` in that window produces neither `CREATED` nor `ERROR` — dropped by the
machine, so not even F9's swallowed-error case.

### T4 / M3 — one slot, N requests, and a broadcast reply

Found independently by four of the six reviews, which is why it is listed once. `createTerminal` overwrites
`pendingTarget`/`pendingCommand` on every `terminal.CREATE` (`fe/features/terminal/state.ts:71`);
`handleTerminalCreated` consumes whatever is there when the next `terminal.CREATED` arrives, with nothing
tying a reply to its request — and `CREATED` is a `broadcastToPlugin` (`be/features/terminal.ts:133`), so it
reaches every window for every creation.

- One window: run "build" then "test" from the Run Script popover before the first reply → **`test` runs in
  the build terminal** and the second terminal runs nothing.
- Two windows: window B asks for a tab; window A clicks New Terminal first → B opens a canvas tab onto **A's**
  terminal, and B's own falls through to the panel. M3's other direction silently detaches a popout's panel
  from the long-running process the user was watching.

**Both are fixed, and they needed two different mechanisms — which is the part worth carrying.** The two
bullets look like one bug and are not: one is *which window*, the other is *which ask*.

- **M3, the cross-window half, was addressed by addressing.** `terminal.CREATED` stayed a broadcast — every
  window's list should grow — and the opening moved to `terminal.OPENED`, which the backend `reply`s to the
  asker on the connection it asked from (`be/features/terminal.ts`). `tests/features/code/fe/terminal-opens-for-the-asker.spec.ts`
  holds the split.
- **T4, the one-window half, needed a correlation, and addressing cannot supply one.** A window can have two
  creates in flight and they are not interchangeable. The envelope's call is what names them: `terminal.CREATE`
  mints one, the intent is recorded under it (`pendingOpens`, keyed, replacing the two single slots), and the
  answer carries it back as `Message.answering` — which `callOf(event)` reads. A terminal's id is minted by
  the backend, so nothing *about the terminal* could have been the key; the call is about the ask instead.
  The "build then test" repro above is a case in that spec, asserted in the awkward order — the first ask
  answered second — since that is what a single slot gets wrong in both directions at once. An entry is
  removed by whichever answer settles it, `terminal.ERROR` included, so a failed create leaks nothing.

`packages/default-setup/CLAUDE.md`'s correlation section is where the general rule lives now.

### M — the multi-window amplifier

Popping out is one menu click (`renderer/src/views/WebApp.vue:144`), and the main window does not navigate
away, so "main on Code" + "popout on Code" is immediate. At most two windows can show Code
(`WindowManager.ts:25,151`).

The amplifier is broader: **every plugin's actor is spawned in every window regardless of what that window
displays** (`abuddy-host/src/features/application/fe/machine.ts:416-418`), and the Code plugin's `entry`
spawns the terminal child. So a popout of *Notes* runs a full Code plugin and terminal child that receives
every terminal broadcast and writes every persisted key. M1, M3, M5 and M6 therefore need only a second
window of **any** plugin.

Nothing reconciles cross-window state: no `storage` listener, no `BroadcastChannel`, and no `partition` in
`webPreferences`, so `localStorage` is genuinely one shared store.

**M4 defeats the fix committed as `508715336`.** That commit marks a seam when a pty is replaced under an
existing pool entry. A window that opens the terminal for the *first time* after the replacement builds a
fresh entry at the new pid and replays the pre-restart scrollback from `localStorage` with **no seam** — the
pid is not stored beside the persisted output. Two windows then show the same bytes, one labelled
discontinuous and one presented as continuous.

### X — the platform asymmetry

Three causes rather than thirteen bugs: process control is written in POSIX signals end to end (X1, X2);
shell assumptions are POSIX (X4, X6, X11, X12, X13); and paths are assumed `/`-separated on the way out of
the backend, where the backend's own `path.*` calls are correct but every FE display path and the OSC decoder
hand-roll it (X5, X7, X8). X3 and X10 are a fourth cause outside the feature — the app is configured for
macOS keyboard conventions only, and the terminal feels it most because a shell claims the same keys.

X1 and X2 were verified against `node_modules/node-pty@1.1.0` source rather than from memory:
`windowsTerminal.js:147` defers `kill`/`resize` until the first data event, `windowsPtyAgent.js:118-121`
throws on resize after exit, `:133-150` kills the console process list **asynchronously** via a forked
helper, and `:229` delays the exit event by 1,000 ms. `runShutdownHooks()` runs inside `process.on('exit')`,
where that async kill cannot complete even on a graceful exit.

### G — agent sessions do not share the pty, but repeat one mistake

**Claude Code does not use `terminalService`.** `node-pty` appears in exactly one file in the repo, and
`terminalService` has two importers (the terminal system, and `hooks.ts` for `killAll`). The agent path uses
plain `child_process.spawn` and reaches the UI through the chat/threads pipeline, never `terminal.*`. **So
F1-F17 do not reach agent sessions** — the review's scope is correct as written.

It independently repeats the write-amplification class, and worse: **G1** flushes
`updateMessageState(messageId, { text: buffer })` with the *entire accumulated text* every 80 ms, and again
for thinking at 250 ms. A 60-second answer producing 40 KB is ~750 flushes averaging ~20 KB → **~15 MB of
LMDB writes and ~15 MB over the bus for 40 KB of text**, quadratic in message length, on every turn. The
event *count* is coalesced correctly; the payload is not. **This is a stronger suspect for the write-discard
issue in `docs/archive/issues/postmortem-pattern-kill-note-loss.md` than F5**, because it runs on every
agent turn rather than only while dragging a divider.

**G3 is the mirror of F7**: the terminal over-kills a stale pid, while the agent path under-kills a live
child — `onShutdown` doesn't touch `activeHandles`, the child is spawned without `detached`, and
`runner.ts:331` signals only the CLI process where the terminal path uses `killProcessGroup`. Quit the app
mid-turn and `claude` keeps running, still using tools, still spending.

## Negative results

Recorded so they are not re-investigated.

- **Terminal output cannot produce a clickable `abuddy://` deep link.** Two independent facts:
  `@xterm/addon-web-links@0.11.0`'s only regex matches `https?` (read out of the shipped bundle) and no
  `urlRegex` option is passed; and `main/src/modules/shell-access.ts:13` allows only `http:`/`https:` for the
  external branch. The remaining gap is S4, which the terminal cannot reach.
- **Claude Code does not share the pty infrastructure** (above).
- **`pty` resize does not oscillate between windows** — every re-fit trigger was traced and none is driven by
  another window or the backend. M2 is last-writer-wins, not thrash.
- **Keystrokes reach the pty once, not twice, with two windows.** `onData` is registered once per pool entry
  and each window has its own pool.
- **`terminalPool` is genuinely per-window** — built-in pack frontends are statically imported into the
  renderer bundle, so each BrowserWindow's realm evaluates its own singleton.
- **Persisted output is not duplicated across windows** — all windows write one key, so replay is one copy.
  The failure mode is truncation (M1).
- **One window cannot prune another's live persisted output** — both prune against the same broadcast list.
- **Tab reorder and drag key on id/path, not index** — verified through `useTabDragDrop` and `reorderTabs`.
- **A stale persisted terminal tab is dropped cleanly** — no ghost, no crash. The defect in that area is T3's
  loss path. (The pinned case is T2.)
- **`maxTerminals` is enforced on create** — the failure is only invisible, which is F9.
- **Round 1's `dataDisposable`/`exitDisposable` leak, `CLOSED` disposal, and `savedScrollFraction` math** were
  each checked and are correct; the newline-boundary trim is deliberate.
- **The same terminal in both canvas and panel is not reachable in one window** — see Corrections. This is a
  fact about today's behaviour and **not** an answer to round 1's open fork: the guards that produce it are
  display conditions, not a stated rule, and M3 already defeats them across windows.

## Root causes

1. **Ownership is diffused.** Three modules own parts of one terminal's lifecycle, so every invariant — one
   host, one handler set, one scroll policy — is a convention. F1, F2, F15, T1, T7 follow.
2. **There are three copies of the scrollback** (xterm's buffer, the bus's string, `localStorage`) and the two
   that were added are the slow, window-shared ones. F3, F6, F11, M1, M4, M6 follow.
3. **Request/reply is modelled as broadcast plus a shared slot.** No correlation id anywhere. T4, M3, and
   half of T3 follow.
4. **A deny-list is used where an allow-list is required** — for the pty env (S1) and for what the bus logs
   (S2). Both went stale because neither has a test that would notice.
5. **A persisted row is treated as a handle rather than as data** — the pid (F7, L2) and the shell path (S3).
6. **Process control, shell assumptions and path handling are POSIX-shaped end to end.** All of X.
7. **Nothing is observable.** No tests, one write-only error channel (F9), and the one log that would have
   shown the input problem is hidden in the UI by default.

## Path forward

### Stage A — stop the bleeding (independent of everything else)

1. **S2**: log the event type and target, never the payload, at the bus seam. One line. Then decide what to do
   about the log files already on disk — they are credential-bearing.
2. **S1**: replace the pty env deny-list with an allow-list, and add the spec that fails when an app-owned
   variable appears in a spawned pty's env.
3. **F9**: route terminal errors through the shell's existing `notify` rather than plugin context, so an error
   nothing renders becomes structurally impossible.
4. **F10**: add `onContextLoss`. Three lines; `1b414d35e` proves context loss happens here.

None depends on the restructure. 1 and 2 are the only items in this document that are about user harm rather
than user annoyance.

### Stage 0 — make it observable before touching the hot path

The pack suite is `environment: 'node'`, so `terminal-pool.ts` is unreachable by it. Add a jsdom project for
the pool and the bus, and `drive/` scripts for the interactive invariants. **This stage is also where F3, F4,
F5 and G1 get measured** — they are currently inferences, and the repo's own rule is to measure before
optimising *and before accepting someone else's measurement*, including mine.

### Stage 1 — one owner per terminal

A `TerminalSession` owning the xterm, the wrapper, the subscriptions and the pty wiring. Views become hosts
that receive a node and emit intent, and cannot register a handler. Fixes F1, F2, F15, T1, T7, and makes
M2/M3/M4 expressible as "a session belongs to one window".

**Whether a session may have more than one visible host is the open fork, and the argument is about ptys, not
about the current code.** A pty has exactly one `(cols, rows)` and emits one stateful stream — alt screen,
cursor, scroll regions all live in it — so two visible hosts at different sizes is not a bug to fix but a
contradiction, which is what M2 looks like in practice. That argues for one host per session, and it would
argue for it even if no guard existed today. The cost of choosing it is the use case it refuses: watching one
terminal in a popout on a second monitor. tmux answers that with per-client sizing or a smallest-common size;
choosing to support it means a real multiplexer (two xterms over one pty, with replay), which is materially
more work. Either way the rule belongs in **one owner** rather than in template conditions a new entry point
can forget — that part is settled by M3 regardless of which way the fork goes.

### Stage 2 — fix the pipe

Coalesce pty data in the backend on a ~8 ms or size threshold; enable node-pty `flowControl` with ack-based
pause; replace the concat ring with a chunk list or drop the second copy and snapshot xterm's buffer with
`SerializeAddon`; move persistence off `localStorage`. Fixes F3, F4, F6, M1, M6, and makes F11 trivial. Apply
the same payload discipline to G1, which is the same defect in another feature.

### Stage 3 — request/reply with correlation, and resize discipline

Give create a correlation id so a reply finds its requester, and scope a session to a window. Fixes T4, M3,
M5. Separately: one resize send per settled size, rAF-debounced, guarded on changed dimensions, and stop
writing EARS on resize at all. Fixes F5 and removes a suspect from the LMDB investigation.

### Stage 4 — stop treating stored rows as handles

Bound or remove the orphan kill (F7); make `killAll` mark rows closed and cap `restoreAll` (L2); validate
shell and cwd on restore after settling F13 (S3); delete or trash closed rows (L3); add `onError` to the
restore actor (L1).

### Stage 5 — platform

X1/X2 need a Windows job object or an explicit tree kill, and a shutdown path that can await. X3 needs a
non-darwin menu. X10 needs `cmd`→`ctrl` normalisation. The rest of X follows from one allow-list and one
path-handling decision.

### Stage 6 — completeness and the F14 decision

Shell integration needs a decision, not a fix, because it has never run. The options, from cheapest:
**delete it** and title from the shell/process name; **listen instead of inject** via xterm's
`onTitleChange`, since most shells' prompts already emit OSC 0/2 and this needs no pty writes and works on
Windows; **do it properly VS Code-style**, injecting through the environment (`--init-file`, `ZDOTDIR`,
`XDG_DATA_DIRS`, `-NoExit`) and shipping rc scripts, which also buys per-command exit status and
re-run-command; or **ask the OS** for the foreground process and cwd from the pid, which needs no shell
cooperation. Then: `SearchAddon`, scrollback/font settings, bracketed paste everywhere, `TERM` set
explicitly, and the dead declarations (L6-L8).

Separate from the terminal but found here: **G2, G3, G4, G6** are four small, independent fixes to the agent
path, and **G1** belongs in Stage 2's payload discipline.

### What makes it stay fixed

- The `TerminalSession` seam, so a view *cannot* wire a handler.
- **Allow-lists with a firing test** for the two places a deny-list rotted: no app-owned env var in a pty, no
  event payload in a log. Each needs a test that fails when the list goes stale — that is what neither had.
- An invariant spec: one attached host, one `onData`/`onResize` per terminal, one window per session.
- A perf budget test: N MB of output must produce at most M events and at most K ms of main-thread time. The
  only thing here that would have caught F3, F4 and G1 before a user felt them.
- A correlation id on every request/reply pair, so "which reply is mine" is not answerable by luck.

## Open decisions

1. **F14** — which of the four shell-integration directions (Stage 6). The current code has never run, so
   there is nothing to preserve.
2. **The log files already on disk** — S2 means `main.log` and `main.jsonl` should be treated as
   credential-bearing.
3. **Repair vs restructure.** The existing code is not a quality baseline and its past fixes were partial or
   failed attempts, so Stage 1 is not obliged to preserve any of its structure. Whether to rewrite the core
   (~1,340 lines: service 430, system 330, pool 362, bus 218) against the invariants above, or to land the
   stages incrementally, is a scope call.
4. **One visible host per session, or a real multiplexer** (Stage 1). Still open. Today's exclusivity is
   emergent from display conditions and is not an argument either way; the argument for one host is that a
   pty has a single size and a single stateful stream, and the argument against is watching one terminal in a
   popout on a second monitor.
