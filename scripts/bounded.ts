/**
 * Runs a command under a wall-clock budget: `tsx scripts/bounded.ts <class> <command> [args...]`.
 *
 * For the npm scripts that invoke a shell script directly. The chain kills a step's process group when it
 * overruns, so a script run *through the chain* is already bounded — but the direct run is the one people
 * and agents actually use, and it had no bound at all. `tests/scripts/test-packaged-authoring.sh` is the
 * worked example: it looks bounded, with `set timeout 120` in its expect block, and is not. That timeout
 * covers a pattern match and not the `wait` that follows, which is how it once hung a machine until three
 * pids were killed by hand.
 *
 * **The budget is a declared class, and these four were the reason Phase 1 of `costs-across-machines.md`
 * was bigger than it looked.** They were seconds, sized "at about four times what the thing costs healthy",
 * which made them this machine's deadlines exactly as `budgetFor` did — and worse, they are *inner* bounds
 * nested inside the chain's outer one, so two of them were already the binding constraint:
 * `test:external-pack:contract` was 90s inside against 144s outside, and `test:packaged-authoring` 240s
 * against 364s. Coarsening only the chain's bound would have left a 90s shell bound killing a slow machine
 * exactly as before.
 *
 * So a step and the script it runs name the same class, and the two bounds agree by construction. The class
 * is still written at the call site, in `package.json`, so it is visible next to what it bounds. A budget
 * nobody would wait for is the same as no budget, which is what keeps the ladder short.
 *
 * **One consequence worth knowing: in a chain run this bound never fires.** The chain's own bound on the
 * same step names the same class and starts first, so it reaches the deadline first and reports the step by
 * name, which is the better message. What this one is for is the *direct* run — `npm run test:packaged-authoring`
 * at a terminal, which the chain is not around to bound and which is the run people and agents actually use.
 * It was deliberately tighter than the chain's before, 90s against 144s, and being tighter is exactly what
 * made it a second machine's problem; equal is the right answer and this is the note saying so, so that
 * nobody tunes one of the pair wondering why the other exists.
