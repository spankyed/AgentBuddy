/** The diff itself, for the one branch of `whyItRuns` that needs it — over the sweep the decision was made on */
/**
 * Which projects will run, and why — asked of all of them at this one moment, over one reading of the tree.
 *
 * A function rather than a block, so the sweep is unreachable the moment it returns. It caches every byte it
 * reads (14.7MB across the host pool's 2,372 distinct input files), and the run it decides on then spawns vitest
 * for as long as the suites take — `freshnessSweep`'s own rule is that a sweep may not outlive the one question
 * it was made for, and holding one across a test run is the worst way to break it.
 *
 * **Yes, the chain has just hashed these same bytes for the step's own fingerprint, and that is priced
 * rather than a thing to fix.** Measured 2026-10-06 — median of 3 on a box another process was using, so each figure is an upper bound and the proportions are what the conclusion rests on —
 * a fresh host pool step is 0.90s, of which 0.38s is
 * `tsx` starting, 0.30s is the nested `packages:ensure` spawn and ~0.22s is this sweep and the prune. So
 * the duplicate read is the smallest of the three parts, and 0.6-1% of a step that runs any tests.
 * Removing it means one cache layer rather than two, which costs the per-project granularity the layer
 * exists for — a one-package edit running one project instead of eleven. Root `CLAUDE.md` carries why two
 * layers are sound here where they were a defect for `packages:ensure`: these two cannot disagree about
 * freshness, being derived from one input function.
 *
 * The verdict goes through the same sweep as the explanation. That is not only the double read it saves: a
 * verdict and an explanation taken from two readings can describe two different trees, which is the shape the
 * chain's report had removed from it a week ago.
