// `npm run check:repro` — build everything twice from one input and report any output whose bytes moved.
//
// **Why it matters: the chain caches on these bytes.** A step that only consumes a build stays cached through
// a rebuild from unchanged input, which holds exactly as long as the build is reproducible. When it is not,
// every step declaring that tree goes stale once per build, and the miss reads as an ordinary input change.
// So the population is every tree a build writes that another step reads — the published packages, the pack,
// and the app — and `repro.spec.ts` derives that completeness from the chain rather than from a list here.
//
// **A diagnostic, not a gate, and nothing else asks this question.** The chain's `freshnessSweep` is often
// mistaken for it: that reports a step whose declared inputs moved *after it ran*, which catches a step
// writing under a tree it also declares and says nothing about two builds agreeing. Nothing fires on a
// schedule for reproducibility; this fires when someone types it. Two full builds is the reason it is not a
// merge gate, and the trade is deliberate (`docs/archive/goals/goal-reproducible-builds.md`).
//
// Reach for it after bumping a bundler (esbuild, vite, tsup, tsx), before cutting a release, or when a step
// keeps going stale after it passed. What it gives that a stale-cache symptom cannot is the answer per file:
// the one diagnosis it has already overturned blamed esbuild and one bundle, where this named three files and
// the real cause, `tsc` ordering a union's members by creation.
//
//   npm run check:repro                 # the whole comparison
//   npm run check:repro 2>&1 | tail -20 # the verdict without the build logs
//
// It rebuilds this checkout's outputs and takes the package-build lock, so against a running chain it fails at
// once rather than racing it. Treat its absence from a green chain as saying nothing: no chain run makes this
// claim.

 * `.apack/generate-entries.json`. Without this line the second round would re-hash codegen output it never regenerated and
 * report it identical — half the population passing for having been looked at, which is the failure this
 * whole check exists to catch. `repro.spec.ts` asserts the flag is still here.
