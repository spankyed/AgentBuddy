// `npm run spec` — run the specs that could fail because of what you changed.
//
// Running one spec is the cheapest check this repo has (1-3s against a chain run), and what made it awkward
// was never vitest: it was deciding what to run and then addressing it. A path from a stack trace is
// repo-relative while the command wants a workspace plus a package-relative path; and after editing a source
// file the honest answer to "what covers this?" took a grep, so the reflex was to run the whole package
// suite instead — 543 tests where 25 would do.
//
// So you do not tell it what kind of thing you are giving it:
//
//   npm run spec                            the specs your uncommitted changes affect
//   npm run spec -- <spec path>             that spec
//   npm run spec -- <name>                  every spec whose path contains it — how you run one while working
//   npm run spec -- <directory>             every spec under it
//   npm run spec -- <source file>           every spec that imports it, transitively, in whatever package
//   npm run spec -- <any of the above> -t "case"     anything starting with `-` goes to vitest untouched
//   npm run spec -- --changed HEAD~1        a different base for the change set
//   npm run spec:full [...]                 and the pack suites a rebuilt `dist` would reach
//
// A **source file** is the case worth knowing about. It used to run the file's own package, which for
// `@abuddy/sdk` was one of the seven suites that cover it: a green run of specs that could not fail for the
// change. It now runs one vitest over every host project, which is what the root `vitest.config.ts` is for.
// That costs what the blast radius costs — a component nothing imports is still 1-3s, a type every pack's
// data flows through is 28s and 104 files. To go back to one spec while iterating, name it.
//
// Where it can, it delegates to the package's own `test` script, so @abuddy/cli's and @app/default-setup's
// pretest guard (`packages:ensure`) and each vitest config still apply. A root run has no such hook, so the
// plan puts `packages:ensure` in front of it.
//
// **Two more edges run through a build, inside a pack.** `src/content/**` compiles to `dist/*.content.json`, which
// `tests/content/` reads against its goldens, and `abuddy.json` drives codegen into `src/__generated__/`, which
// every spec in the pack imports. The walk still runs — an apply helper the specs import directly is answered by
// it — and carries what it could not see (`Run.beyond`); `npm run spec:full` builds the pack and runs them.
//
// What a module graph cannot reach is a **pack suite**: it resolves the published `dist` while the host
// projects resolve source, so its specs never import `packages/<dep>/src` and no import edge runs from the
// file you edited to the spec that covers it. `npm run spec` says so when it is true — derived from the
// declared dependencies, so editing a package no pack depends on says nothing — and `npm run spec:full`
// answers it, at the cost of a build (14s when stale) and the pack suite (18s).
//
// **Three exit codes, because the three need different next moves and only one is a bug in the code:**
//
//   1  a spec failed — the ordinary one
//   2  a name was wide enough to be a search, so the paths were listed instead of run
//   3  nothing ran and nothing passed: no spec covers the target, or the specs that do sit behind a build
//      this run is not doing (a pack's content sources, its build inputs) — `npm run spec:full` answers those
//
// 3 is the one worth knowing about. `vitest related` exits 0 when the module graph reaches no spec, so until it
// existed "nothing covers this" and "everything covering this passed" were the same output and the same code —
// and five of eight sampled entry modules answered zero. A run only earns that judgement if its route promised
// coverage of a file a spec could cover (`Run.claimsCoverageOf`): a whole-suite run, a `-t` filter that matched
// no case, and a `.md` target all report zero correctly.
//
// **Two flags of its own.** `npm run spec:dry` answers "what would this run, and what did the last run on
// this machine measure it at" without running any of it. It collects — ~1.6s whatever comes back — which the ordinary run never
// does: the collector and the pricing load behind `await import`, and repo-checks asserts that from this
// file's source. And `--no-bail` reports every failure in the plan rather than stopping at the first, for
// when you want the whole picture in one run; bailing is the default because a 1s failure otherwise pays for
// the pack suite behind it.
//
// `scripts/lib/spec-plan.ts` decides all of that and is asserted by a spec; this file runs what it returns.
