/**
 * `npm run typecheck`: every cheap static check, run concurrently.
 *
 *   npm run typecheck              # all of it
 *   npm run typecheck -- --cores 1 # one at a time, for a measurement or a confusing failure
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT AN `&&` CHAIN ANY MORE
 *
 * It was one, and every leg is a single-threaded compiler, so the step used one core for half a minute while
 * nine sat idle. Measured 2026-09-27 on a 10-core machine: **29.3s one at a time, 10.8s all at once**. Inside
 * the chain it was worse than either — 63.4s — because the rest of the chain saturated the cores it was not
 * using and starved the one it was.
 *
 * That corrected a claim in `chain.ts`'s header, which argued against running the steps together on the
 * grounds that "every step already uses all the cores". The largest app-free step did not, and the chain
 * admits on what each step takes now rather than counting them.
 *
 * WHY EACH LEG'S COMMAND IS SPELLED OUT
 *
 * For whoever reads the table, and nothing more — **which is a correction.** This paragraph used to say two
 * checks read the commands from here through `reachableText` (`lib/npm-scripts.ts`), and that
 * `schema:check` and `exports:check` were reachable *only* this way, so a template literal would hide them.
 * Measured 2026-10-06, all three parts are false: `reachableText('typecheck')` follows one file, this one,
 * whose own text makes no `npm run` call, so its `invoked` set is `{ typecheck }` and the legs are invisible
 * to the scan however they are written; and both of those checks are chain steps in their own right, found
 * without going through here at all.
 *
 * **Where a template literal does bite is the root manifest, not this table.** `namedByScript`
 * (`lib/typecheck-legs.ts`) derives a leg's cache scope by reading the *root* `package.json` script text
 * for `-w`, `--workspace` and `tsc -p packages/x` — and it throws rather than defaulting when it cannot
 * resolve what it found, which is what keeps that one honest.

/**
 * What of the machine the legs may take: all of it, because nothing else is running.
 *
 * Every leg is one `tsc`, so each weighs one core and a budget of ten runs ten of them — which is why
 * this shares the chain's scheduler and its one unit rather than counting legs of its own.
 *
 * **This command is not in the chain any more.** Each leg is its own chain step, so the chain's scheduler
 * owns the whole machine and this runs only when a person runs it directly, where there is nothing to
 * share with. The bound it used to carry was half the cores, "because the chain runs two other lanes
 * beside this step": a guess about a scheduler it could not observe, and the two-schedulers problem
 * `docs/archive/plans/test-unit-scheduling.md` removed for the unit suites and left here. It cost a
 * measured 63.4s in-chain against 29.3s of work, because the rest of the chain saturated the cores it was
 * not using and starved the one it was.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-27 on ten cores, run alone, the step is flat from four at a time up — 12.9s at 3,
 * 11.2s at 4, 10.6s at 6, 11.5s at 8, 11.2s at 16 — because one leg, `typecheck:fe`, is most of the
 * floor. So the exact number above four buys nothing, and taking all of them costs nothing now that
 * nothing else wants any.
 *
 * `box()` rather than `os.cpus().length`, which counts the host's cores where this reads a container's
 * quota — `core-budget.ts` has the reasoning, and this was the last place in the repo getting it wrong.
