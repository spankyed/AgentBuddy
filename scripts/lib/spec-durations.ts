/**
 * What each spec file took in the run that just happened, as that run's own reporter recorded it.
 *
 * Three consumers: the pool prints its slowest files, a `@slow:` marker on a spec that is no longer slow
 * fails the step, and `spec:dry` prices a plan from the last run on this machine. All three are answered
 * from one run on one machine, which is the whole reason this can exist at all — `spec-cost.json` recorded
 * a millisecond per spec in git and compared it across runs and machines against a fixed edge, and the
 * quantity turned out not to be one number: a spec reads 2.8s in the fast pool and 0.64s in the integration
 * pool, so each half's reading demanded a move the other took back.
 *
 * **The asymmetry is what makes one of the three a gate.** Load inflates a duration — measured 1.27x
 * median, 2.03x p90, 3.29x max — so it can hide a stale marker and cannot invent one. A marked spec that
 * reads fast is therefore a fact about the spec, and is failed; an unmarked spec that reads slow may be a
 * fact about the machine, and is only ever reported. Swapping those two directions is the mistake that
 * cost the deleted subsystem its window, its band and its two idle floors.
 *
 * ## When to delete the gate, and what it is costing while it lives
 *
 * **The gate is the part of this with a condition on it**, and the outlier detector is now part of it —
 * `OUTLIER_GAP`, `OUTLIER_FLOOR_MS` and `outlierIn` inform the same decision and so carry the same
 * condition. With `SLOW_QUANTILE`, `tailBar`, `SLOW_MARKER`, `slowReason`, `markedSpecs` and
 * `placementOf` that is ~256 lines here and six of `spec-durations.spec.ts`' seventeen describes —
 * **about 505 of the 1,855** across this module, its reporter and their specs, re-counted 2026-10-06
 * after three commits of additions (it read "320 of 1,356" and a pricing rule with a stale denominator
 * prices nothing). Everything
 * else is the parse, the ranking, the totals, the cache, the window and `spec:dry`'s pricing, which are
 * read whether or not a marker is ever checked. So deleting the gate leaves the instrument intact.
 *
 * **What it guards is five annotations, in one direction, and its failure mode is a stale comment.** What
 * it is *for* is the decision underneath: whether a spec should move between halves. **As of 2026-10-06
 * that decision has been made zero times** — `run-install.spec.ts` is the standing candidate, named in
 * `goal-placement-without-a-clock.md` and worth ~4.4s of the worst `npm run spec` loop (93 specs, 24.4s,
 * from an `@abuddy/sdk` entity-type change), and nothing has moved it.
 *
 * So: **if a year of this repo's work passes without one spec having moved halves on this gate's
 * evidence, delete it** and keep the ranking. That is a judgement and not a thing a run can check, which
 * is why it is written here rather than asserted — the mechanical half, that the marker population has
 * not collapsed to nothing, is already a case in `markedSpecs`' describe.
 *
 * And price any addition against that figure before making one. The subsystem this replaced grew to 1,884
 * lines by answering each objection with another mechanism, and the lesson recorded for it in the root
 * `CLAUDE.md` — *"price the apparatus against the decision it informs"* — applies to its successor first.

 *
 * **Two, because a warning that fires on ordinary variance is one people learn to skip.** Measured over

 * sat at 3.39-4.09x before, the integration half at 1.20-1.62x, the pack pool at 1.06-1.90x. So 2x is
 * above every quiet reading and below every firing one, and the midpoint of 1.90x and 3.74x in the ratio's

 * becomes work worth doing, and it is also what keeps 2x from tripping at ~4s: a half's slowest file has
 * to be both out of line *and* big enough to act on.
