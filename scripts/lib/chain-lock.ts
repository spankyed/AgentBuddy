// the other took against a different tree — and a step marked `cached` would mean "some run with these inputs
// passed" rather than "this tree passed". Nothing noticed before: the freshness sweep reports a step whose
// inputs moved mid-run as a step that will not be cached next time, which is a caching note over a
// correctness fact, and only after both runs have already spent the time.
//
// It is a module of its own because `chain.ts` runs the chain on import (a top-level `await main()`), so a
// spec can only reach this by it being here — the same reason `chain-stamps.ts` and `chain-flags.ts` exist.
