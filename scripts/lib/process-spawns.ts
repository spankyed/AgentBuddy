/**
 * Where a test file starts a subprocess, read from its syntax tree.
 *
 * **The question is what a file can do, not what its arguments say.** The check this replaces asked whether
 * a call's argument text matched `/\b(tsc|vue-tsc|TSC_VERSIONS)\b/` and whether its callee was in a
 * hand-written list of spawner names. Both halves were wrong on the tree they shipped against: it reported
 * three spawning specs where there are twelve, and the one it caught was the cheapest of them. It missed a
 * spec running `node <CLI> build` twice (no compiler in the argument text), one calling
 * `spawnSync(command, …)` through a variable (nothing to match), and `execFile`, which the list omitted
 * while carrying both other sync/async pairs.
 *
 * So nothing here is named. The names come from the `child_process` import in each file, however it is
 * spelled, and a spawn is a call of one of them. Hoisting a binary path into a const, renaming a helper and
 * reaching for a different `child_process` export all stop mattering, because none of them is what is read.
 *
 * **A file is named for holding a call, not for reaching one.** `tests/_support/pack-builds.ts` exports a
 * `run` that spawns, so it is named once rather than fanning out to every spec that imports it — measured,
 * that fan-out over-collects, because most importers want the in-process `callCli` and never spawn. The
 * cost is that a spec calling `run` is not itself named; what it imports is, which is where the call is.
 *
 * Three things it does not see, none of them present in this tree, all cheaper to record than to detect:
 * `require('child_process')`, a dynamic `await import('node:child_process')`, and a re-export
 * (`export { spawn } from 'node:child_process'`), whose caller binds the name from somewhere else.
