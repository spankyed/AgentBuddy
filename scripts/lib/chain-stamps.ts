 * directory can be read.
 *
 * **It is not injective, and `chain-stamps.spec.ts` is what makes that safe.** `a:b`, `a/b` and `a-b` all
 * come here as `a-b`, so two steps whose names differ only in a separator would share one record — and
 * sharing a record means running either one marks the other fresh, which is the chain skipping a step that
