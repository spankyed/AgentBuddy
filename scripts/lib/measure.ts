/**
 * What a timing run decides: whether the machine is quiet enough to measure on, what a series of samples
 * says, how a number should be quoted, and what its arguments mean. Mostly pure; the sampling and the
 * burners are here rather than in either command because two of them need each, and a second copy of
 * either is a second answer to one question.
 *
 * The definition, not the command — `scripts/measure.ts` is the command over it, the same split as
 * `scripts/test-unit-pool.ts` over `scripts/lib/unit-pool.ts`. Separate so a spec can assert the arithmetic
 * and the refusals without timing anything, which is the only way a decision like *"this run was too busy
 * to believe"* stays true.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Five numbers in `goal-integration-pool` were wrong and three reached commit
 * messages: file-time quoted as wall time, a baseline measured while another agent's suite shared the box,
 * a 71s→46s improvement that was really 49.1s→48.2s, a prediction never measured at all, and a spec cost
 * recorded at load 71. Every one came from a hand-rolled `date +%s` loop with no idle gate and no
 * repetition. The doctrine was already written down; the tool was not, so each measurement re-invented the
 * method and re-invented the mistake.
 *
 * **Why it reads `os.cpus()` rather than anything else.** Both gates written during that session were
 * broken, and both in ways this avoids. One parsed `top -l` output and read the word `idle` instead of the
 * number before it, reporting 0% forever. The other matched process names, and matched idle editor language
 * servers that live for hours at 0% CPU and never exit, so it could never have opened. Cumulative CPU
 * counters are numbers already, from an API that cannot be renamed out from under the reader.
 *
 * Load average is deliberately not used: measured 2026-09-29, `os.loadavg()[0]` read 3.20 on a box that was
 * 78.7% idle. It lags by design, and waiting on it is waiting on the wrong thing.
