/**
 * The timing facts a spec file declares, read from its syntax tree: the timeout overrides it sets, and the bare
 * waits it takes.
 *
 * A size budget lives in a vitest config; a third argument to `it()` overrides it for one test. A guard that
 * reads only configs sees the policy and not the escape, which is how fifteen overrides of 60s to 240s sat
 * in small suites whose budget is 15s.
 *
 * **Read with the compiler, not a regular expression.** Two attempts at matching the source text failed in
 * both directions: `}, 500)` matched `setTimeout(() => {…}, 500)` inside a fixture string and gutted it,
 * while `beforeAll(async () => { … }, 240_000);` on a single line matched nothing at all. A timeout argument
 * is a position in a call expression, so the tree is what knows where it is.

/**
 * The size of the test target a file belongs to, which is what decides the timeout budget it fits inside.
 *
 * There are three targets and this answers for any file in one: a package's fast half, a package's
 * integration half, and the E2E suite. It takes configs and specs alike, because "what budget applies
 * here" is one question and was briefly two functions in two modules deciding it by different means.
 *
 * **The two means are the asymmetry, and it is real.** A config's *existence* is the fact — a package has
 * an integration half exactly when it has an integration config, which is how `INTEGRATION_SUITES` is
 * derived in the first place. A spec's *name* is only a claim: a package without that config runs
 * everything in its fast half, so `x.integration.spec.ts` there is `small` whatever it is called.
 * Checking the claim against `INTEGRATION_SUITES` rather than naming a package is the part with a firing
 * case — naming one put the 8 integration specs in `repo-checks` and `publish-checks` under a small
 * budget while they ran large, invisibly, because neither had a per-test override and the *configs* were
 * already derived.
 *
 * **Not `halfOfPath`, which answers a different question.** That one says which half a spec is *in*, by
 * suffix alone, and `spec-cost` renames files to move them between halves — so the suffix is its subject
 * rather than a hint. The two disagree on exactly one input: a `.integration.spec.ts` in a package with
 * no integration config, which `halfOfPath` calls integration and this calls small. No such file exists,
 * and one would be caught anyway — it would run in neither half, and `spec-cost:check` reports a spec it
 * never measured.
