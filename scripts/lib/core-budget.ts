// What of the machine each chain step takes, so one scheduler can admit them on cores.
//
// The chain has had a scheduler for steps since `chain-schedule.ts` and none for cores: `--lanes 3` meters
// a single-threaded `tsc` leg and a nine-worker vitest pool as one unit each. Measured 2026-10-02 on a
// 10-core box, that is 3 of 10 cores through the typecheck phase and 18 workers on 10 through the test
// phase — the same two-schedulers problem `chain-steps.ts` names over `TYPECHECK_STEPS`, which flattening
// the legs fixed for their *scheduling* and left standing for the pools' *sizing*.
//
// **Nothing here imposes a width; every entry describes one.** `test:integration` caps itself in its own
// config and the two unit pools take vitest's default. Those configs stay literal, which they have to:
// `check:specifiers` reads them as text and cannot read a computed value. So this table is a second record
// of a fact, and the kind that re-takes its answer — `core-budget.spec.ts` holds every entry to the config
// it describes, so a cap that moves fails there rather than drifting from here.
//
// A **share** of the box rather than a core count, so an entry means the same thing on any machine and a
// case about it is not about the box it ran on.

 * is one nobody maintains. An entry is a claim about a pool, and something has to stand behind it.
 *
 * **`build:app` and `compile` are the two entries nothing declares**, so they are measured rather than
 * described, and that distinction is why they were left out until the admission policy became the default
 * — which was the condition, and it is met. Without them both weighed one core while vite and esbuild
 * fork, so the chain over-admitted beside the two steps on its critical path.
 *
 * What stands behind a measured entry, given this table has neither the hysteresis nor the busy-machine
 * refusal `spec-cost.json` carries: **an integer core count is its own band.** 1.6 and 2.2 both round to
 * two, so the jitter that hysteresis exists to absorb cannot move either one, and a scheduling weight
 * wrong by 0.4 of a core changes an admission only where it sits on the budget's boundary. A third such
 * entry needs the same argument made for it — the rounding has to do the work, not the measurement — and
 * `core-budget.spec.ts` can only hold the declared kind to its config, never this kind to anything.
