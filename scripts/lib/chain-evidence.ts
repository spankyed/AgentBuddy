// What a run leaves behind for whoever reads it afterwards: one file per step that ran, holding exactly the
// bytes the step produced.
//
// **A failure's output was the one thing a run did not keep.** It was captured, printed once and dropped, so
// its lifetime was terminal scrollback — which is why the guide had to tell people not to pipe a backgrounded
// run, a procedure standing in for a mechanism. Worse, the chain's own classification retry re-runs the
// failed step and its output went nowhere at all, so the diagnostic threw away the cleanest signal there is.
//
// It is a module of its own because `chain.ts` runs the chain on import (a top-level `await main()`), so a
// spec can only reach these decisions by their being here — the same reason `chain-stamps.ts`,
// `chain-lock.ts` and `chain-flags.ts` exist. The command over it is `chain.ts`.
//
// **Nothing here is specific to the chain**, which is deliberate but not yet exercised: `scripts/typecheck.ts`
// and `scripts/test-unit-pool.ts` buffer a child's output in the same shape (`EvidenceResult` is what both
// their result types already are) and keep none of it either. They do not need this yet, because both write
// what matters to their parent's stdout — and the chain is that parent, so a chain run's files already hold a
// typecheck leg's failure and a pool project's output. What is missing there is a *passing* leg's output on a
// direct run, which is a run someone is watching. A second orchestrator adopting this is what decides how two
// of them share `runs/`; a field here for one that does not exist yet would be dead rather than ready.
