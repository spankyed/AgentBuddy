/**
 * What the compiler says it read, as a dep file.
 *
 * A **dep file** is the build-system name for a tool reporting its own input set after the fact —
 * Buck2's `dep_files`, Ninja's `depfile`, `gcc -MD`. TypeScript writes one whenever `incremental` is on,
 * and every typecheck leg in this repo sets it (`tsBuildInfoFile`, into `node_modules/.cache/tsbuildinfo`,
 * which is why it survives a `dist` clean and is absent on a fresh clone).
 *
 * **It is a proxy, in this repo's taxonomy** (root `CLAUDE.md`, "Three kinds of recorded artifact"): it
 * records what was read *last* time, so it can go stale from an input nobody listed. That was what bit the
 * API report stamp, the repo's other proxy until it was deleted for the derivation it stood in for — which
 * leaves this and `build-reads.ts` as the two that remain. It is the known unsoundness of dep files
 * generally, and it is why Bazel pairs them
 * with sandboxing and Gradle pairs them with "undeclared means uncacheable". Here it is paired with
 * `trustworthy()` below and with the rule that a missing dep file is not a cacheable state.
 *
 * **Buck2 uses `dep_files` to prune rather than to key, and that was measured here and declined.** The
 * pruning shape is sound where keying is not: leave the declared set as the key, and when it says stale,
 * skip anyway if every file that *moved* is one this file says was never read — never on an addition or a
 * removal, which are the cases that change resolution without changing a file anyone read, and which
 * `changedInputs` already reports apart from modifications. What it would buy, measured 2026-10-02 over
 * single-file edits: **one or two of the stale typecheck legs per edit**, not fifteen. An edit to
 * `abuddy-ears/src/edge-store.ts` makes 18 legs stale, and 11 of them genuinely compiled it — everything
 * resolves that source under the `@abuddy/source` condition — while 6 of the 18 have no dep file to prune
 * with at all. Against that: 52ms to parse all 16 of these on every chain invocation, a 6% tax on the 0.9s
 * warm floor, and a new stamp field to tie a dep file to the run that was stamped, since a dep file from a
 * failed run records a subset and would prune too much.
 *
 * **The number that makes it moot is where the time is.** The 18 legs are 49s of the chain's 423s, and the
 * critical path is 125s through `packages:ensure -> compile -> build:app -> test:packaged-authoring`; none
 * of the five most expensive steps is a leg. Pruning every leg to zero would leave that path untouched.
 *
 * Do not read "the legs declare far more than they read" as slack: they do (0-21% of declared files are
 * read), but the padding is `dist` trees and configs that rarely change, while the source that does change
 * is mostly genuinely read. That ratio is a fact about declaration shape, not an opportunity.
 *
 * **The same question was put to the two expensive pool steps, which have no dep file to ask.** A vitest run
 * reports no read set, so it was answered from history instead — how often each declaration was a reason to
 * run — and it came back the same way: the breadth is paid by the step's startup and absorbed by the
 * per-project cache inside it. The measurement and what it declined to change are recorded on `suiteInputs`
 * (`chain-steps.ts`), beside the declaration it is about.
 *
 * Revisit if a leg lands on the critical path, or if the app-dependent steps stop dominating it.
 *
 * `build-reads.ts` is the same kind of evidence for the other tool this repo can ask: `abuddy build`,
 * whose bundlers report their module graphs. The two are kept apart because everything below is shaped by
 * TypeScript — one cache directory, one suffix, a compiler version per workspace, a dep file traced to the
 * tsconfig that named it — and a bundler's record answers none of those questions.

 * answer for nobody. `dep-files.integration.spec.ts` refuses one, correctly, and the chain then fails on

 * compilers that write these, so it calls this before its legs run: before, because a leg mid-write must not
 * have its file taken, though an orphan is safe by construction since no running leg writes a name no

 * repo has three of them: the renderer's configs write a build info under `node_modules/.tmp` with an
 * empty `fileNames`, because a solution-style config records its references and not a program. Returning
 * `[]` for those would let a coverage check pass over a leg it learned nothing about, which is the exact

 *
 * Paths in any `node_modules` are dropped, which is the one thing here that is a judgement rather than a
 * reading: they are dependencies, overwhelmingly TypeScript's own `lib.*.d.ts`, and the chain already
 * covers one moving through `package-lock.json` in every step's inputs. **Any** `node_modules`, not a
 * leading one — a package can have its own, and 8401 of the reads recorded here are inside one.
 *
 * **The paths come back lowercased on a case-insensitive filesystem**, which is TypeScript's doing and
 * not something to correct here: it records `baseform.vue` for `BaseForm.vue`. A caller comparing these
 * against a walk of the tree has to fold case or it will report a declared file as undeclared, which is
