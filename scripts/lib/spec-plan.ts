 * What `npm run spec` runs for what you gave it, as data.

 * The definition, not the command — `scripts/spec.ts` is the command over it, the same split as

 * without running anything, which is the only way a decision like *"a source file runs every spec that
 * covers it"* stays true.
 *
 * **The rule.** A spec path, a directory or a name names specs directly, so those run in the package that
 * holds them — that is what you asked for. A **source file** is a different question: after an edit you
 * want *what could this break*, and the answer is every spec that imports it, transitively, wherever it
 * lives. That question used to be answered with the file's own package, which for `@abuddy/sdk` meant one
 * of the seven suites covering it, reported green.
 *
 * Vitest already answers it properly: the root `vitest.config.ts` lists every host project and `related`
 * resolves the module graph across all of them **in one process**. So a source file plans one root run.
 * Measured 2026-09-26: `packages/abuddy-sdk/src/types/sdk-entities.ts` reaches 104 files, and
 * `scripts/lib/chain-steps.ts` 4 where the old route found 3 — it is both wider and transitive.
