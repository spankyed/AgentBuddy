 * load-bearing well beyond any one command — `chain-steps.ts`' `INTEGRATION_SUITES` and `NATIVE_SUITES` are
 * the suites with that half's config (`hasHalf`), which is the whole chain's view of which suites have one.
 *
 * **Declared, never derived from a measured cost**, because the quantity is not one number: a spec read 2.8s
 * in the fast pool and 0.64s in the integration pool, so each half's reading would demand a move the other
 * took back.
