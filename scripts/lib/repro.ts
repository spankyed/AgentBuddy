/**
 * Outputs measured as irreproducible, with the cause, so a difference at one of them is reported rather than

 *
 * **Empty, and it took holding three entries to get there.** The first run recorded
 * `pack-types.d.ts`, `action-defs.d.ts` and `snapshot.json`, all of them `tsc` printing a union's members in
 * the order it created the member types — an order that changes between builds, so the same sources emitted
 * different bytes. That was fixed rather than accepted: `sortLiteralUnions`
 * (`@apack/cli`'s `build/declaration-text.ts`) now sorts them at the one point that writes a declaration bundle, and six consecutive builds produce one
 * hash where `action-defs.d.ts` alone had taken five in six.
 *
 * So a new entry here is a claim that something cannot be fixed, and it needs the measurement to say so.
 * Note the one asymmetry if one is ever added: a stale entry is *reported*, not failed, because this class of
 * nondeterminism is a race and a run where one happens to agree is not evidence it is gone.
