/**
 * What `abuddy build` says it read, per pack.
 *
 * The companion to `dep-files.ts` and the same kind of evidence: a tool reporting its own input set after
 * the fact, which is the only check in this repo that can catch a step declaring *too little*. The
 * typecheck legs are observed through TypeScript's `tsBuildInfoFile`; the two steps that run `abuddy build`
 * were observed by nothing until that command started recording its bundlers' module graphs
 * (`@abuddy/cli`'s `build/build-reads.ts`, which writes the file this reads).
 *
 * **A separate module rather than a shape inside `dep-files.ts`**, because that one is tsc-shaped
 * throughout: one hard-coded cache directory, a `.tsbuildinfo` suffix, a TypeScript version resolved per
 * workspace for the trust check, and a dep file traced back to the tsconfig that named it. A bundler's
 * record answers none of those questions, and dropping it in there would have failed three of its cases.
 * What the two share is the discipline, not the code: `undefined` means no evidence and never `[]`, and the
 * self-check runs inside the reader so no caller has to remember it.
 *
 * **It covers the bundling phases and not the step.** Codegen, the tsx-loaded seed compilation, the feature
 * settings load and the static pack rules have no tool to ask, so they are absent from the record rather
 * than reported empty, and the step stays on `dep-files.integration.spec.ts`' list of what nothing verifies
 * per-step. A step reading as verified over part of its work is worse than one honestly listed.
