/**
 * Where the import rules look: the packs, the packages, and the files under a given path.
 *
 * The definition, not the rules — `scripts/check-import-specifiers.ts` is the command over it, the same split
 * as `scripts/spec.ts` over `scripts/lib/spec-plan.ts`. These were four separate regions of that file, far
 * enough apart that `PACK_CODE_DIRS` was declared after seven functions that take it as a default.
 *
 * **It walks the filesystem, and cannot ask git.** Every function here takes a `root`, and the rules' own specs
 * pass one from `mkdtempSync` — a fixture tree that is no git repository, where `git ls-files` answers nothing.
 * So this is a different answer to "what files are there" from `repoFiles()` in `@app/repo-checks`, on purpose
 * rather than by accident: that one asks git because its subject is this repo, and this one cannot because its
 * subject is whatever directory it is handed. `SKIPPED_DIRS` is the price — a hand-kept partial of `.gitignore`.

 * This checkout's packs, walked once.

 * Measured 2026-09-30: a whole-repo `check:specifiers` made **103 286 `readdirSync` calls**, reading single
 * directories 189 times each — one full walk per `packDirs()` call, and the rules make about 189 of them.
 * That was 2.06s of the run's 4.6s, and the population walk everyone assumes is the cost is 5ms.
 *
 * **Only for this repo's root, which is what makes it need no reset.** A walk cannot be keyed on content
 * the way `pack-features.ts`'s `publishedEntryPoints` keys on a manifest's mtime and size — a directory's
 * mtime moves when its own entries do, not when something three levels down changes — so the alternative
 * was a `resetSourceCache()`-shaped hatch, and that is the thing two specs remembered, the repo's most
 * expensive spec did not, and which left it quadratic until `7c4b8aacc`.
 *
 * Two facts make the condition sound, neither of them guarded — a spec pinning the first is worth writing:
 *
 * - **No test reaches it.** Every one builds its tree under `fs.mkdtempSync`, so `root` is never this one.
 * - **Nothing adds a pack to this repo mid-process.** The tools that read it exit; the one that writes
 *   (`npm run specifiers:fix`) rewrites specifiers inside files it already found.
