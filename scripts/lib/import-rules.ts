 * for every pack outside this checkout, and running a second implementation here is how two copies of one rule
 * drift apart (`docs/goals/goal-one-rule-set.md`). What this adds is the repo's shape: each `dir` may be a
 * pack's `src`, a pack's `tests`, or — in a spec — a directory standing in for one, and paths are reported
 * relative to the repo rather than to the pack.
 *
 * One rule at a time, so it does not get `packRuleProblems`' "one offence, one message" — there, a pack author
 * reading a build failure is told once by the rule whose cause comes first. Here the rule *is* the subject:
 * `--rule <id>` runs one; `--list` names them all, says which an external pack is held to as well (a rule with
 * a `packRule` is one `apack validate`, `build` and `test` run), and prints what doing without each of the
 * rest costs a pack — answering from the entries rather than from a table in a doc, which is what a survey of
 * this taken by hand went stale as. A rule that stood down would make a per-rule run's
 * answer depend on which other rules ran. What keeps that from becoming two answers to one question is that
 * both run the same rule — its `check` per file, its `checkPack` once for the pack — and `FIRES`' disjointness
 * sweep asserts no two rules claim one offence to begin with, for every rule this delegates to.
