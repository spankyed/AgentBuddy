 * Refuses rather than rebuilds, which is the difference between a checker and a fixer.

 * A report generated against a stale `dist` is a report about the wrong tree, so the freshness has to be
 * established — but **establishing it by building makes this a step that writes what it declares as its
 * inputs.** Measured 2026-10-05, when it did: `api:check` rebuilt `@abuddy/testing` mid-chain and the
 * freshness sweep then named twenty steps that had passed and would not be cached, with
 * `packages:ensure`'s own output as the file that moved under them.
 *
 * So the chain's `packages:ensure` is what makes this fresh, and a run from a terminal is told to. That is
 * the rule `@abuddy/testing`'s guide states for the same pair: a fixer belongs to the command a user runs,
 * and a checker must not try to repair.
