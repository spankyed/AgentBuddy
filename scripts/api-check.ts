/**
 * `npm run api:check`: every published package's API reports, regenerated and compared, concurrently.
 *
 * It was `npm run api:check -w @apack/ears -w @apack/sdk -w @apack/ui`, which npm runs **serially**. The
 * three are independent — each compiles its own declarations and extracts its own reports — so the step spent
 * its time one core at a time. Measured 2026-10-05 on a ten-core box, warm `dist`: **12.5s serially against
 * 7.1s together**, for the same 22-23s of CPU. The cores it takes are declared in `POOL_WIDTH`, so the chain
 * admits it against the rest of the budget rather than counting it as one.
 *
 * **It checks and never repairs**, which is the half that cannot change: `api-reports.ts` refuses a stale
 * `dist` rather than building one, because this is a chain step and a step that writes what it declares as an
 * input leaves every later step stale. `npm run api:update` is the fixer and carries `packages:ensure`.

 * Ahead of the three, so a stale tree costs nothing rather than three compiles.
 *
 * `api-reports.ts` refuses as well, and that is not a second rule — it is the same function called at the
 * other door. Each package's `api:build` runs its own `tsc` *before* `api-reports.ts` loads, so the refusal
 * there arrives after ~2s per package has already been spent; its job is to catch a direct
 * `npm run api:check -w @apack/sdk`, which never reaches this file. This one is for the command the chain
 * runs, where the cost is three of those compiles.
 *
 * **A new caller of this is a new freshness door, and the doors are a numbered table**
 * (`packages/apack-testing/CLAUDE.md`) — most of them are npm scripts, and JSON carries no comments, so
 * nothing but that table says a door exists. Copying this line without adding a row is how door 8 arrived
 * unrecorded; no check holds the table, which describes kinds of door rather than call sites.
