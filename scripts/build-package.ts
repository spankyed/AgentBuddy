// Builds a workspace package's dist/ with tsc: ESM and declarations, no source maps (src doesn't ship).
// @abuddy/ears and @abuddy/sdk are built exactly alike, so they share this script the way the bundled
// packages share bundle-package.ts:
//
//   tsx ../../scripts/build-package.ts .        (from the package directory)
//
// Its package.json is what the published manifest is derived from: its exports resolve source under the
// @abuddy/source condition (the repo's own configs) and dist otherwise, and `stagePublishTree` writes the
// tree npm publishes into publish/, without the branches a tarball cannot satisfy. Relative imports name the .ts
// source and tsc rewrites them to .js (rewriteRelativeImportExtensions), so the emitted JS resolves in
// Node and in bundlers as is.
//
// It lives here rather than in each package because it reads the repo's build rule
// (@abuddy/host/build/packages-built), and a package's own scripts import no package above their layer.
