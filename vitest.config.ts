     * The host unit suites as one vitest run, so they share one job pool and one worker budget.
     *
     * Two schedulers with no shared budget was the ceiling: `scripts/test-unit.ts` scheduled suites while
     * vitest scheduled the files inside each one, so a third lane oversubscribed within a suite rather than
     * filling idle cores. Vitest's sequencer takes every project's files as one list and sorts it
     * longest-first, which is the greedy makespan approximation across package boundaries.
     *
     * Each project loads its own config, which is where its environment, setup files and per-project
     * settings live — nothing is flattened here.
     *
     * **The pack suite is not here, and cannot be.** `@app/default-setup` must resolve the published
     * `dist` while these resolve source, and Node conditions are per process: vitest shares its worker pool
     * across projects and ignores per-project `poolOptions.execArgv`, measured. Under a pooled process
     * carrying the condition, a `default-setup` spec resolves `@abuddy/sdk` to `src` where it resolves
     * `dist` today — it would not have failed, it would have quietly tested something else. So there are
     * two pools, split on the boundary `check:specifiers` already enforces.
     *
     * Written out rather than derived from `UNIT_SUITES`, because `check:specifiers` reads this file as
     * text and cannot read a computed list. `chain-inputs.spec.ts` asserts it is exactly the host suites,
     * so it cannot drift.
