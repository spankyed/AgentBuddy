 * What a pack's compiled content is: their bytes, and the names of the files holding them. **Content only.**
 *
 * The names as well as the bytes, so a seed moved between files, added or dropped counts — the same reason
 * `fingerprintUnit` hashes a unit's declared paths beside its contents.
 *
 * **File times are deliberately not in here, and used to be.** `placePack` copies into a fresh directory and
 * renames it over the old one, so every install leaves new files whatever they contain; hashing their mtimes
 * made a reinstall of the identical pack look like changed data, which was the point — reinstalling was how
 * you got a pack's data put back. It also made a `touch` re-apply, and made every `abuddy run` backend rebuild
 * re-import every seed, since that loop reinstalls. Content is what "changed" means here, as it does
 * everywhere else in this repo that compares a tree against a record.
 *
 * Putting a pack's data back on purpose is `IMPORT_PACK_CONTENT` (`features/packs/be/types.ts`), which Settings
 * drives with a preview, a per-key selection and a collision mode — more than a reinstall ever gave, and it
 * leaves this record alone, so asking for the data again does not change what counts as changed.
