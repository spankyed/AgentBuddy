 *
 * **It throws rather than falling through**, which is the whole of what this list buys. Real Node
 * resolution of a missing subpath dies on the SDK's extensionless relative imports — an error about a
 * file, naming nothing a pack author can act on. The loader records a load problem and the other packs
 * load, so a pack built against an SDK entry this app no longer has is a pack reported missing with the
 * reason attached, rather than one that fails obscurely.
