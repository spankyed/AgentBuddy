/**
 * Packages the host resolves for a pack, because neither the bundle nor the installed pack can carry them.
 *
 * Two shapes, both discovered the same way — the failure names the file it could not find:
 * - a **native binding**. `node-pty` requires `build/Release/pty.node`; `chokidar` optionally requires
 *   `fsevents`, whose binary is the same story. A `.node` is compiled machine code, so esbuild has no loader
 *   for one and the only answer is to resolve it at run time.
 * - a **shipped executable**. `@vscode/ripgrep` computes `rgPath` from its own `__dirname`, which inside a
 *   bundle is the bundle's directory and not the package's.
 *
 * So a pack bundle leaves them external (`@abuddy/cli`'s `be-bundler.ts`) and the bridge resolves them from
 * the loader (`withModuleBridge`'s `hostPackages`, `packs/runtime/bridge.ts`). Resolving from the loader is
 * the half that has to be here: `stagePack` copies a pack's `dist/{runtime,build,types}` and nothing else, so
 * an installed pack has no `node_modules` for an external specifier to come from, wherever it was installed
 * from. `packages/api` declares the two this app ships, and `electron-builder.mjs` packages both its
 * `node_modules` and the hoisted root one, which is what makes them resolvable beside the API bundle.
 *
 * A pack needing one this app does not have falls through to its own resolution and fails there, naming it —
 * a question about that pack rather than about this list. `fsevents` is the counter-example: chokidar
 * requires it in a try/catch and falls back to polling, so a pack runs without it either way.
