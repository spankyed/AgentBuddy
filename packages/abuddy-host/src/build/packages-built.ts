 * It reads every byte, and that has been proposed twice as the thing to optimise — record each input's
 * `(size, mtimeNs)` in the stamp and skip the hashing when they all match, as Bazel and Turborepo do.
 * Measured on this repo before taking that trade:
 *
 *     417 files, 2.5MB      walk (readdir) 3ms | stat every file 1ms | walk + hash 24ms
 *     npm run packages:ensure, everything fresh: 345ms
 *
 * So the hashing is 24ms of a 345ms command; the other 320ms is the npm spawn, node and tsx starting,
 * and modules loading. Stat-before-hash would save about 20ms, in exchange for a cache key that is right
 * unless a file changes content while keeping its size and timestamp. Bazel makes that trade over
 * gigabytes and thousands of targets; over 2.5MB it buys 6% of one command. Not worth it — if this cost
 * ever matters, the 320ms of process startup is the part to attack, by calling `stalePackageUnits()`
 * from a process that is already running rather than spawning one.
 *
 * Re-measured 2026-09-28 at the largest scale this is asked at, a chain sweep over twelve units and 39.1MB,
 * because the 1ms row above is for 417 files and reads as though stats were nearly free:
 *
 *     12 units, 18001 files (3518 distinct)   walk (which stats every path) 205ms | walk + read + hash 661ms
 *
 * The conclusion is unchanged and the arithmetic is worse than it looks, in three ways. The stats **are** the
 * walk — `inputFiles` already takes one per path and drops it — so they are not an alternative to it and the
 * ceiling is the 456ms of reading and hashing, not the whole 661ms. Skipping the hash for a whole unit whose
 * stats all match saves that only on a tree where nothing moved, and a unit whose stats have moved pays both:
 * 861ms against today's 661ms. On this tree, with no edit outstanding beyond a commit, 8 of 10 stamped steps
 * had a file newer than their stamp — a run of the chain is a run you made because something changed, so the
 * regression is the ordinary case and the saving is the rare one. And a per-file version, hashing only the
 * files whose stats moved, needs the fingerprint composed from per-file digests rather than a byte stream,
 * which moves every recorded fingerprint. That used to include three committed files, until the proxy that
 * read them was deleted for the derivation it stood in for; the cost now falls on chain stamps alone.
 *
 * What did pay, for the same 5.1x overlap, was reading each distinct file once per sweep: see `freshnessSweep`.
 *
 * Note this is a different question from the one the header answers. There, mtimes are rejected for
 * deciding whether *output* is current, where a failed build leaves a complete-looking tree that reads
 * as fresh forever. Here they would be a cache key over *inputs*, which is sound in principle — the
 * reason not to is the arithmetic above, not the same objection.
 *
 * `collect` receives each file's own digest as this walk hashes it: the same files, in the same order, in one
 * pass. It is how a caller that has to say *which* file moved gets an answer that
 * cannot disagree with the verdict, because both come from here. A second walk of its own can disagree, and
 * one did — an mtime walk named a file an E2E test rewrites with identical bytes, and the diagnosis that
 * followed was wrong. The returned hash is unaffected, so a caller wanting only the verdict passes nothing.
 *
 * `tree` is where the walk and the bytes come from, defaulting to looking now (`readTree`, whose `ENOENT` rule
 * this loop used to hold inline). Injected rather than cached here, because a cache has a lifetime and this
 * function has no business owning one: `freshnessSweep` does, for the callers that ask about many units at one
 * moment.
 *
 * It still computes a fingerprint for a caller that wants only the digests (`changedInputs`). Measured at 9ms of
 * that caller's 53ms, against splitting this loop into something two projections consume — which would also
 * dissolve the case that proves the digests and the hash agree, since they would no longer be taken together. The
 * 9ms is the cheaper of the two.

 * One reading of the tree, shared by every question asked of this sweep.

 * Units overlap heavily — measured on this repo, twelve chain steps declare 18,001 files between them and only
 * 3,518 distinct ones, and 807 declared targets of which 311 are distinct. So the primitive reads `packages/*`
 * and the shared trees five times over and walks them nearly three times over. Through a sweep each file is read
 * once (456ms of reading and hashing becomes 153ms) and each target walked once (129ms becomes 30ms), and the
 * fingerprints come out byte-identical, because what is shared is the looking and not the derivation.
 *
 * **A sweep must not outlive the one question it was made for.** It answers as of its first read of each file, so
 * a sweep kept across time reports a tree that has moved on. Holding an object is what makes that somebody's
 * decision rather than a default they inherit.
 *
 * **The chain's dispatch decisions use one too, and what makes that sound is the graph rather than this
 * function.** Every reader of a step's output is ordered after that step, because `dependsOn` *is* that
 * relation — derived from `outputs` landing in `inputs`, not declared beside them. A sweep reads lazily, so
 * the first read of any path that some step produces happens after that step has finished. There is no
 * window in which a shared reading holds bytes a later step has overwritten.
 *
 * The sentence this replaced predates that: `needs` was hand-written beside inputs that only implied it, so
 * two records could disagree and reading per step was a net under a property nobody had made structural.
 * Measured on this repo, per-step reads cost 1715ms against 189ms shared, over 28 steps.
 *
 * `forget` is kept as a local net rather than a load-bearing part, and the honest note is that **no
 * end-to-end case distinguishes having it from not**: editing a package's source so `packages:ensure`
 * rebuilds makes `packages:check` re-run either way, because it is ordered after the rebuild and reads the
 * tree for the first time there. What would make this load-bearing is a step reading a path it is not
 * ordered after — which `sweep-forget.spec.ts` holds to zero for transient writes, the one kind that
 * creates a mutex instead of an edge.
 *
 * What a sweep cannot see either way is a write from outside the chain — an editor saving mid-run. Neither
 * can per-step reads, for any step already dispatched; and `willNotCache` reads the tree afresh once
 * everything has stopped and names every step that passed and is already stale again.
