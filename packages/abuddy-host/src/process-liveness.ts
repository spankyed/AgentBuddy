/**
 * Whether the process that wrote a record on disk is still running: the database write lock, the instance
 * lock, staging dirs, the dev server's marker, and the API's own port file.
 *
 * A pid alone cannot answer it. Pids are recycled, so a record a crash left behind names whatever took its
 * number, and reads as live for as long as the file exists. Bounding the pid by when the record was written
 * clears that, at the cost of the opposite error.
 *
 * Which error to prefer isn't a property of the pid, it's a property of the question being asked, and two
 * different questions are asked here: may I take this lock, and is this recorded handle still worth using.
 * So there is a predicate per question rather than one predicate and a flag. Each owns its own reasoning,
 * `true` is the cautious answer in both, and the shapes differ enough that neither can be typed where the
 * other was meant.
 *
 * Neither is exact. A pid space of ~100k against a few thousand live processes recycles within one long
 * uptime, which the bound cannot see either. The exact answer is the holder's start time
 * (`/proc/<pid>/stat`, `ps -o lstart`), read per platform; the answer with no staleness at all is an OS
 * advisory lock (`flock`/`LockFileEx`), which the kernel releases on process death. Reach for those if a
 * record's staleness ever has to be settled rather than estimated. A cheaper half-step, for the records
 * this app writes itself, is to record the writer's own start time in the record and bound by that instead
 * of the file's mtime, as `@abuddy/host/build/packages-built` does with its lock's `startedAt`: an mtime is
 * whatever last touched the file, a recorded `startedAt` is the writer saying when it began. It doesn't
 * reach every caller — Chromium writes the instance lock, and a staging dir carries its pid in its name —
 * so it would shrink this problem rather than end it.
 *
 * `readApiEndpoint` is here too: it is the one reader outside this file that needs the bound, and what a
 * running process published belongs with whether that process is still there.
