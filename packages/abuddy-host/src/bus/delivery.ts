// Names the message a system is handling, for the duration of the call that delivers it.
//
// **It is a plain variable, set and restored around the send, and that is the whole mechanism** — the same
// one the renderer uses, so the two halves of the app behave identically and there is one thing to know.
//
// It was an `AsyncLocalStorage` until this file said otherwise, because `reply()` read the scope *at the
// moment it was called* and a backend handler routinely answers after an `await`. That requirement left when
// `reply` became something a handler is *handed*: the wrapper reads the delivery synchronously as the handler
// is entered (`_replyTo(_currentDelivery())`, `@abuddy/sdk/framework`), before any `await` can have happened,
// and the handler closes over the result. Measured on removal — the whole host suite (3077) and the pack
// suite (787) passed, `reply.spec.ts`'s two-overlapping-asks case included, which is the case its own header
// named as the one thing a single variable could not do.
//
// **What is given up is a label on four sends.** Across both packages, four sends are made after an `await`
// inside one action — `database`'s `resetDatabase`, which fires `RESTART_BRAIN` and three plugin
// notifications. None of them is answered, so none needs a return address, and `Message.from` still names the
// pack because that is stamped from the pack's identity rather than from here.
//
// **What is gained is more than one mechanism instead of two.** An async store is inherited by anything the
// handler creates inside it, a timer included — so a send made minutes later, long after the asker stopped
// waiting, carried that asker's address, and a `reply` made there would have answered a request nobody was
// listening for. Binding at entry cannot do that: a handler either took an answer with it or it did not.
