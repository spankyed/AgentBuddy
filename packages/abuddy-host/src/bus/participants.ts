// Names claimed by a connection rather than registered by a pack.
//
// A system and a plugin are addressable because a pack declared them: the registry knows their refs and what
// events they take. A driver is neither — it is a process outside the app holding a connection — and that is the
// whole reason an agent had to reconstruct "was this for me?" from a correlation id. It could send, and nothing
// could send to it.
//
// A claim closes that with no new address grammar. `host/drive` is spelled like any other feature ref, so
// `splitRef`, `resolveName` and every gate that reads one keep working untaught, and `sendToSystem('host/drive',
// …)` resolves the way the rest do. What differs is only where the answer comes from: the registry for a pack's
// features, this for a claimed name.
//
// The caller is the drive engine (`abuddy-testing/src/engine/index.ts`), which claims `host/drive` once its own
// socket is open. `participants.spec.ts` covers the mechanism, including that an unclaimed name is still
// dropped; what it cannot reach is that caller, being a Playwright session in another package.
//
// **A claim lives exactly as long as its connection.** That is what makes it safe without a disconnect signal:
// the id it is keyed by is minted per WebSocket connection and dies with the socket, so a driver that goes away
// cannot keep a name, and one that reconnects claims again. `release` exists for the socket's own teardown, not
// as something a caller has to remember.
//
// A claim is keyed by a plain string rather than a `FeatureRef`, deliberately. `FeatureRef` is branded and
// "made only by `resolveName`", so narrowing an arbitrary string into one would defeat the brand at exactly the
// boundary it exists to guard. A claimed name arrives from a client, is checked against the ref grammar where it
// arrives (`bus.claim`), and is stored as what it is: a string that looked like a ref.
