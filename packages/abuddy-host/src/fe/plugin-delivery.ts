// **At the seam rather than in the shell, because more than one feature hands events to actors.** It was the
// application feature's, and the packs feature reaching it is the cross-feature import `check:specifiers`
// refuses — which left that feature sending to the shell's actor directly, and a direct send is the one thing
// this exists to replace. A port two features need lives here, as `pack-frontends.ts` does.
//
// **Two functions, because a hand-off either answers a question or does not, and that is not a flag.** Every
// send to an actor in this window goes through one of them. Which one a call site picks says what it is doing,
// and the asked one takes an address that cannot be absent — so a caller holding a maybe-asker has to say what
// it does when there is nobody, in the branch rather than in a sentinel the type could not check.

/**
 * Hands an actor an event someone is waiting on, naming the asker for as long as it is handled, so the
 * handler is handed a `reply` that reaches them.
 *
 * **The address is a parameter and cannot be absent**, which is the whole of what the shape enforces. It was
 * `_Asker | undefined` with a `NOBODY_ASKED` constant beside it, and twelve of the fourteen call sites passed
 * that constant — so the sentinel *was* the default spelling, and a careless fifteenth site would have copied
 * it from its neighbour exactly as readily as it would have omitted an argument. A required parameter whose
 * usual value is a name for nothing asks for a token, not a decision. Two functions ask for the decision.
 *
 * What no signature prevents is a caller that *has* an asker calling `notifyPluginActor` anyway. That is a
 * semantic choice, and `tests/features/application/fe/plugin-reply.spec.ts` is what catches it.
 *
 * **The scope a *sender* was in does not reach the receiver**, which is the second thing this buys and the
 * reason the bypasses were worth closing: measured 2026-10-06, a plugin reaching the shell's actor directly
 * from inside its own delivery left the shell handling the event as that plugin, with that plugin's asker — so
 * a send the shell made there was stamped with a plugin that did not make it, and a handler it ran was handed a
 * `reply` addressed to a system that had asked the plugin something else.
 *
 * **Both take an actor, not a lookup that may miss.** Whether a missing plugin is a bug or an ordinary race
 * differs by call site — the shell's own lifecycle sends address a plugin it just spawned, where absence is an
 * invariant broken and worth a crash, while a send arriving for a plugin whose pack has unloaded is neither. A
 * `?.` here would have levelled those two to the quieter one, which it briefly did.
