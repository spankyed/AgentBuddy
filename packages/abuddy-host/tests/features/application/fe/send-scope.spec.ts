// The two sends differ in reach, and nothing pinned it until now — which is how `OPEN_PLUGIN_FROM_APP` came about:
// a backend `OPEN_PLUGIN` reaches every window, so a popout would have followed the main window's navigation, and
// the event had to be renamed and guarded per window instead.
//
// `broadcastToPlugin` (backend, over the bus) reaches **every** window showing that plugin, because a plugin runs
// once per window. The renderer's `sendToPlugin` reaches this window's only. Two shells over one backend is the
// cheapest faithful way to say that: each shell is a window, and the bus delivers to both subscriptions.
