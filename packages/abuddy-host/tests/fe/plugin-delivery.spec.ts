// Handing an event to an actor names the participant it is for — and *only* that one.
//
// Two claims, and the second is the one that had no case until a probe went looking. A send made while
// handling a message carries the handler's ref, which is what the whole delivery scope is for; so a plugin
// that reaches another actor's `send` directly, from inside its own delivery, hands that actor its own
// scope. Measured 2026-10-06: the shell handling a pack unload that way saw itself as the *packs plugin*,
// with the packs system as its asker — so a send it made there would have been stamped with a plugin that
// did not make it, and a handler it ran would have been handed a `reply` for a question asked of somebody
// else.
//
// That is why nothing may reach an actor's `send` around these two functions. `check:specifiers` cannot see
// the difference — both are `.send(` — so this is where the difference is held.
//
// **Two functions rather than one with a nullable address**, so a call site names what it is doing and the
// asked half cannot be called without an answerable address. Which one a case uses is therefore part of what
// it asserts, not an implementation detail of the fixture.
