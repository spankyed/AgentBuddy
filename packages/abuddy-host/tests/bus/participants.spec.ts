// Being addressable without a pack having registered you.
//
// A system and a plugin are addressable because a pack declared them; the bus checks every outgoing message
// against what the target plugin says it receives, and drops one nothing declares. A driver is declared by
// nobody, which is why an agent could send to the app and the app could not send back — the gap this closes.
//
// A claimed name takes the same grammar as a feature ref, so nothing that reads a ref had to be taught about it.
// What it does not take is a declared event list: no pack describes a driver, so there is nothing to validate
// against and whatever it is sent reaches it.
