// Asking a system to publish what it holds — the one thing every cause on this bus comes down to.
//
// A client connecting, a pack changing and the data being replaced are three facts with one consequence:
// every system says what it holds now. That consequence has a name of its own (`SEND_STATE`), so a system
// wires it once instead of once per cause, and a fact is left for what publishing cannot fix.
