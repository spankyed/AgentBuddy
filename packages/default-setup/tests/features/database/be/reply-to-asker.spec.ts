// A query's result goes to the view that ran it, not to every window.
//
// Two windows each show the Database plugin with their own editor and their own pending request, and a
// `broadcastToPlugin` reached both. `reply` answers the sender of the message being handled, on the connection
// it came from — so a person querying in one window and an agent driving in another stop seeing each other's
// results.
//
// What this file cannot check is the *delivery narrowing*: the harness has one client, so `emitted` sees
// whatever the bus put out whether or not it was addressed. The addressing itself is covered where it lives
// (`@abuddy/host`'s `tests/bus/reply.spec.ts` and `@app/api`'s `tests/transport/sub-scope.spec.ts`). What is
// covered here is the pack's half: that the handler answers its sender at all.
//
// Every case connects first: the bus holds sends to plugins until a client does, so an answer would otherwise
// have nowhere to go. The one case that deliberately does not is the last.
