// The trace viewer's flow events: a reply that names which page of which flow it is, against a view that
// has moved on.
//
// Every `GET_FLOW_EVENTS` assigns `currentFlowId` and the offset it asked for before it sends — both the
// auto-select on the flow list and an explicit selection — so the reply's own `flowId` and `offset` tell
// it from an answer the viewer has left behind. Without the flow half, clicking two flows quickly shows
// the first one's events under the second.
//
// **The offset half was the gap this file used to describe rather than cover.** `FLOW_EVENTS_RESULT`
// echoed `flowId` and `hasMore` only, and `setFlowEvents` decided append-or-replace from whatever offset
// the context had since reached — so re-selecting a flow while a later page was in flight let that page
// *replace* the whole list, page two shown as if it were the flow. The reply carries its `offset` now,
// which is what lets the viewer place an answer by the page it is for instead of by where it has got to.
