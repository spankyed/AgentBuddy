// The logs system collects what any code logs, through onLog, and sends each entry to its plugin. It's the
// pack's early system (the app starts it before the others and delivers its messages), which the harness's startApp
// doesn't run, so the test starts its machine on the test host, whose bus is the bound runtime's. Its sends to the
// plugin go through the app's bus, which delivers them once a client is connected.
