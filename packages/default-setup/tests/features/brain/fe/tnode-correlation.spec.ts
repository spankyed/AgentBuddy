// The brain view's node details: a reply that names the node it describes, against a view that has
// already moved on.
//
// `answersSelectedNode` admits a reply only for the node in `selectedStepNode`, so the reply is
// identifiable without a request id — a handler that takes whatever arrives shows the wrong panel after
// two quick clicks. **What that costs is an invariant: every action that asks must select first**, and an
// action that forgets is not wrong loudly, it is answered into a guard that drops it.
//
// This file used to assert the invariant over two of the four asking actions and state it as a fact about
// all of them. The fourth was the counterexample: a step's error asked for the failing node's details and
// never selected it, so the panel that exists to show them was never given any.
//
// The last case asks each asker the same question — *is the node you asked about the one you selected?* —
// and reads the node off the send rather than restating it, so the **assertion** holds for an asker nobody
// has written yet. The **list of triggers is still written by hand**, so a fifth asker has to be added to
// it; that is a line, and saying so is better than leaving the list looking derived.
