// A terminal is announced to every window and opened in one — the backend half of that split.
//
// `code/fe/features/terminal/state.ts`'s spec covers what each window does with the two events; this covers
// which window is sent which. The pair is the same one the flows system makes, and the case that pins it is
// the second: an ask with nobody to answer must produce the news and no answer at all. Swap the `reply` for
// a broadcast and that case fails.
//
// The service is stubbed because creating a terminal spawns a process, and nothing here is about pty.
