// Which file's diff opens in which tab.
//
// `commit.DIFF_RECEIVED` carries the diff's own `path` and `staged` (`GitDiff`, `code/be/types.ts`), so
// the answer says which file it is about. The handler built the tab from `context.selectedGitFile`
// instead — the file selected *now* — so selecting another file while a diff was in flight opened the
// first file's content in a tab labelled the second.
//
// This is the keyed-slot rule at its cheapest: the tab id is the key, the payload already carries it,
// and reading it is the whole fix. Nothing needs a pending field.
