// Which answer a PR view takes: the one in its own slot, keyed by what it asked for.
//
// A diff is a view fetching data, and the rule for that job (`packages/default-setup/CLAUDE.md`) is a slot
// keyed by what was asked: a late or another window's answer writes its own key, the view reads the key it is
// showing, and there is no guard anyone can forget. **A guard cannot do this job here**, which is the reason
// to reach for the key and not merely a preference: the branch-only asker compares against no head, so any
// check on the answer's head must admit an answer carrying none — and two PRs onto one base, the ordinary
// case, then let a branch diff land as a PR's files.
//
// The file-diff half keeps an in-flight check as well, because its answer **opens a tab**: a key decides
// which row to write, not whether there should be one. That is the limit the guide names, and the two halves
// are tested separately because they are two different mechanisms.
