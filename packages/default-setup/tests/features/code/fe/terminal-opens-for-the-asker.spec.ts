// A terminal opens in the window that asked for it, and appears in every window's list.
//
// Those are two jobs and they used to be one event. `terminal.CREATED` is a broadcast — `broadcastToPlugin`
// reaches every window — and its handler both grew the list *and* routed the terminal into this window's
// panel and ran the pending command. So opening a terminal in one window opened it in all of them, and ran
// there a command nobody had typed there.
//
// The id is minted when the terminal is created, so nothing *about the terminal* could identify the ask — a
// slot keyed by what was asked for cannot settle this one. Two things settle it instead, and they answer
// different questions. **Addressing** says which window: the news stays a broadcast and the answer is replied
// to the asker (`code/be/features/terminal.ts`), the same split the database system makes between
// `TRANSACTION_RESULT` and `DATABASE_REFRESH`. **The call** says which of that window's asks, which addressing
// cannot — a window can have two creates in flight, and the intent held for each (a tab or the panel, a
// command to run) is not interchangeable, so one slot could not hold both.
//
// `answerTo` is how a spec with no delivery door in front of it builds an answer that names a call.
