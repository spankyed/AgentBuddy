# @app/typescript-floor

A private workspace that installs nothing but `typescript@5.7.3`, the oldest TypeScript `@abuddy/sdk` and `@abuddy/ui` support. Their `typescript` peer is `>=5.7`, the version `ai` 7's declarations need. It has no source.

## Who uses it

`packages/abuddy-cli/tests/helpers/published-packages.ts` points `TSC_VERSIONS['5.7']` at `packages/typescript-floor/node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc`, next to the workspace compiler (`current`). `CONSUMER_MATRIX` crosses both compilers with `node16` and `bundler` module resolution, and these specs compile a consumer against the built packages for every combination:

- `published-sdk-types.spec.ts`
- `published-ui-types.spec.ts`
- `published-exports.spec.ts`

They need `npm run packages:build` first; without `dist/` they skip, except in CI, where they fail.

## Changing the floor

The pinned version, the `typescript` peer ranges in `packages/abuddy-sdk/package.json` and `packages/abuddy-ui/package.json`, and the `'5.7'` key in `TSC_VERSIONS` move together. Update the root `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/public-facing` wherever they name the version. Pin an exact version, not a range, so the specs test the actual floor.
