// The drive session's own connection to the running app's API, so a bus verb reaches the API directly instead
// of through the window. A broken window is then just a broken window: `/qx` keeps working while the
// renderer's own subscription is dead.
//
// No dependencies, Node having had a global `WebSocket` since 22 and this repo requiring 23 — what is left to
// write is tRPC's frames, which are below.
//
// **The frames, read out of `@trpc/server@11.16.0`'s installed adapter** (`dist/ws-*.mjs`, and
// `parseTRPCMessage`), not from memory — a hand-written protocol is the thing most likely to break on a bump, so
// the version it was read at is recorded here and `api-client.spec.ts` pins each shape:
//
// ```
// → { id, jsonrpc: '2.0', method: 'mutation',          params: { path: 'bus.claim', input: { as } } }
// → { id, jsonrpc: '2.0', method: 'subscription',      params: { path: 'bus.sub' } }
// → { id, jsonrpc: '2.0', method: 'subscription.stop' }                      // no params; cancels by id
// ← { id, jsonrpc, result: { type: 'started' } }                             // advisory, may follow data
// ← { id, jsonrpc, result: { type: 'data', data } }
// ← { id, jsonrpc, result: { type: 'stopped' } }
// ← { id, jsonrpc, error: { message, code, data: { code: 'CONFLICT', … } } }
// ```
//
// Three of those are a mistake away from a bug, so each is named: **success is `'result' in frame`, never
// `result.data`** — `bus.send` and `bus.claim` return nothing, so their success frame is
// `{"result":{"type":"data"}}` with no `data` at all. **`PING`/`PONG` are bare text, not JSON**, and must be
// skipped before parsing. And **an error is followed by `stopped`**, so a channel must not report twice.
//
// **No reconnection, deliberately.** A drive session is one run against one app launch. The socket can only die
// three ways: the app closed, so the session is over; the API crashed and was restarted on a possibly different
// port, so the claim died with the old process and the port we hold is stale; or the subscription itself failed
// while the socket lived. Only the second could be recovered, and doing so would re-fire `CLIENT_CONNECTED` to
// every system in the app. So the channel records why it is finished and every later verb fails saying so,
// which an agent can act on — rather than reconnecting into a session whose claim somebody else now holds.
