 * launching an app. `attachedSession` below assembles the same four pieces over a page nobody here
 * launched, which is what lets `createSession` not know which it was given.
 *
 * **It returns when the session ends**, which is the one structural requirement. The fixture's teardown
 * is the code after `await use(...)`: a body that never returns skips `app.close()`, the listener
 * removal and the data-dir policy. So `/close` resolves this, and a signal resolves this, rather than
 * either killing the process where it stands.
