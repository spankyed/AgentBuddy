/**
 * Attaching to an app somebody else launched.
 *
 * `_electron` has no `connect`, which is where *"whoever launches owns the page"* came from. But an
 * Electron renderer is Chromium, so `chromium.connectOverCDP` attaches to one that was started with
 * `--remote-debugging-port` and hands back a real `Page` — and every verb is a call on a `Page`, so the
 * same `asSessionPage(page, appHelper(page, dir))` serves a connected page and a launched one with no
 * second implementation. That is the whole of what this module adds: the connect, and finding the window.
 *
 * **What an attached page cannot do is reach the main process.** `electronApp.browserWindow(page)` has no
 * CDP equivalent, so a real window resize is unavailable and `asSessionPage`'s `window` is left out —
 * which it already treats as "nobody is watching" and answers with the emulated viewport.
 *
 * `playwright-core` is imported lazily and is an optional peer: a published CLI must not drag 11MB into an
 * install of someone who only runs `abuddy build`, and nothing but this path needs it.
