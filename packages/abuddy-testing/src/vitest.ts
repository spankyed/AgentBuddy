 * What a pack's SFCs become in its tests, and why they are not compiled.

 * mounts a Vue component**. What every pack needs instead is a module graph that *resolves*, because
 * `vitest related` and `--changed` walk it from the file you edited — and without this they die on the first
 * `.vue` they reach, which is any pack with a plugin.
 *
 * This is the third place the toolchain answers that question the same way, so it is the convention rather
 * than a shortcut: `abuddy init`'s `env.d.ts` declares `*.vue` as a generic component for `tsc` (*"Plain
 * `tsc` can't read .vue files"*), and `abuddy build` stubs `.vue` and `.css` for the backend bundle (*"The
 * backend runtime never renders them"*). A stubbed SFC is also never *parsed*, which is why a pack's own path
 * aliases need no handling here: nothing inside one is resolved.
 *
 * It throws when rendered rather than returning an empty component, because a component test that silently
 * asserts against nothing is worse than one that fails.
