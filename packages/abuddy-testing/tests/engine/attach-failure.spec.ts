// What a session does when a step after the attach fails, and how long it waits for `host/drive`.
//
// Both subjects are one defect: two questions asked at once against one app. The second's claim is refused
// — correctly, since two drivers must not receive each other's answers — but the refusal was reported and
// then nothing closed the CDP connection or the socket, so the process sat there for ever. Measured before
// the fix: `abuddy drive --eval` printed its reason to stderr and was still running 25s later.
