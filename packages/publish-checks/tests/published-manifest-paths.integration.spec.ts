// In the expensive half because it packs, which is the line this suite's two halves are drawn on.
//
// **Moved 2026-10-06, on the slow report's evidence and against a recorded decision.** It was the one spec
// in the fast half that packed anything — five `npm pack --dry-run` subprocesses — and `CLAUDE.md` kept it
// there on the strength of that costing ~1.5s. It measured **3.74s of the half's 4.5s**, 83% of it, so the
// figure the decision rested on was 2.5x out of date and the fast half was this spec with three
// near-instant specs beside it. That is the first time a placement decision here has been revisited with a
// number rather than an impression.
//
// Which half a spec is in stays a decision, declared by this filename and re-derived by nothing.
