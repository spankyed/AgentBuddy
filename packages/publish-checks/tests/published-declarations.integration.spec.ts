/**
 * The published declarations, checked with `skipLibCheck` off.
 *
 * Every other consumer check compiles with `skipLibCheck: true`, as a real consumer does — which is
 * the point of those specs, but it means nothing ever looks inside the `.d.ts` files we ship. An
 * error in there is invisible: a type that fails to resolve becomes `any`, and a consumer sees no
 * error at all, just a member that silently stops being checked. That is the failure this catches.
 *
 * `skipLibCheck: false` alone would also check every third-party declaration (vue, ai, xstate and
 * their trees), whose errors are not ours to fix and would make this fail for unrelated reasons. So
 * the program is built with checking on and the diagnostics are then filtered to the files under
 * `node_modules/@apack/`, the same way `facade-typing.spec.ts` scopes a pack's own facades.

 * setting, and the check would compile the other two and report green having never read that package's types.
