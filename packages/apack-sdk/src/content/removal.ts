// How one content item's entity is removed — the one rule, for a caller that has only its entity type.
//
// It exists because the two writers each know their own half and the app has a third caller that knows
// neither: the user answering "delete it" on an item their pack stopped shipping (`DELETE_CONTENT_ITEM`,
// `@apack/host`'s packs system), which holds a content key and the entity type the applied content
// recorded. Destroying the entity there is wrong twice over — a flow's nodes and wiring are separate
// entities that would be orphaned, and an entity type whose pack registered a `remove` writer has a delete
// of its own, which for a soft-deleting type is what keeps the user's undo.

 * the item being removed is the pack's and the root role is not a reason to keep an entity the content no
 * longer declares. Anything else goes through its pack's `remove` writer, and an entity type with no
 * writer is destroyed, which is what the generic applier does.
