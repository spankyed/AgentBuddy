// Reading another surface's state by ref, untyped: the escape hatch beside the typed readers `#generated/fe`
// generates from each surface's contract, as `untypedQx` is beside `qx`.
//
// `useSurface()` answers "the surface I am rendered by", which needs a `SurfaceScope`. Extension components —
// artifact viewers, tiptap command items, step forms — are rendered by the host wherever they belong, with no such
// scope. They reach a surface by its ref instead.
//
// Both return `TSelected | undefined`, because a ref is a name and nothing about a name says the surface is running:
// another pack's frontend may still be loading. The generated readers narrow that away for a surface in the calling
// pack, which is spawned in the step that registers it — codegen knows which case it is, and a caller here doesn't.
//
// The actor comes from the shell's registry, the app's one list of running surfaces: a surface is spawned with its
// ref as its XState `systemId`. Nothing here keeps its own.
