 * rather than something a pack hands over. No designation, no provider, no registration: a pack that wants
 * to ship commands writes documents, and a pack that wants to *edit* them edits documents.
 *
 * **One source, so no precedence rule.** Every command is a field of a document of
 * `COMMANDS_DOCUMENT_TYPE`, so there is nothing to merge and no declaration a document could shadow.
