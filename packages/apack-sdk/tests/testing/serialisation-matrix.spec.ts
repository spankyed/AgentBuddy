// The three value-serialising passes that live in this package, each against its own row of the matrix.
//
// The matrix is data (`src/testing/serialisation-matrix.ts`) because no package can import all five passes —
// the encoder is `@app/api`'s and `toJSON` is `@apack/cli`'s, and each asserts its row in its own suite. What
// that buys is that a cell cannot drift from the code: `docs/reference/value-serialisation.md` is the same
// answers in prose, and these are the ones that fail.
//
// The differences between the rows are deliberate and the doc says why. What this file is for is that they stay
// the differences somebody chose.
