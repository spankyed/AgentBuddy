   * Only `@apack/source` on the entry is what keeps it out: `publishedManifest` drops an entry that condition
   * was the whole of, so it reaches no tarball and no `etc/*.api.md`, and a pack cannot resolve it because a
   * pack's config may not declare the condition. Adding a `types` branch would at least surface as a new
   * report file; adding only a `default` one, or re-exporting it from the published `./testing`, would not.
