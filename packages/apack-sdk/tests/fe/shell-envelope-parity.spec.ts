// The shell's `SEND_TO_PLUGIN` is a second envelope, and this is what stops a field being lost in it.
//
// `deliverInWindow` (`events/index.ts`) is the window's counterpart of the bus: it takes a `Message` and
// hands the shell a `SEND_TO_PLUGIN` built **field by field**. So a field added to `Message` and not named
// there simply does not reach the plugin — no error, no dropped message, just a value that is never read.
// Every other boundary the envelope crosses has a guard against that: `bus.send`'s schema is held by
// `api/tests/transport/bus-send-sender.spec.ts`'s `Required<Omit<Message, 'client'>>` sample, and the drive
// client's hand-written mirror by `apack-testing/tests/engine/bus-message-parity.spec.ts`. This door had
// none, which is why the field it would have lost is the one this file was written for.
//
// It is deliberately **not** full parity: the shell event is a different shape by design — `plugin` and
// `events` in place of `to` and `event`, an `asker` the shell resolves, and no `client`, a window being one.
// What has to carry across is the part a plugin reads, which is the correlation.
