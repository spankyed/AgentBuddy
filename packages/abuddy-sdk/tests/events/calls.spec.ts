// Every send names a call, an answer names the call it answers, and the two verbs a pack reads it through.
//
// Correlation is a three-step obligation — mint, store, settle — and a per-feature implementation can fail
// at any one of the three independently: mint and never store, declare a field and mint nothing, store and
// never clear. The envelope is what removes the first and third from a feature's hands: the send mints and
// `reply` echoes, so a feature only stores.
//
// What is asserted here is the half no feature can see: that a send stamps a call at all, that an answer
// names the request's rather than its own, that the reserved key reaches the receiver's event, and that
// `answersCall`/`settleCall` refuse what a hand-written comparison would accept.
