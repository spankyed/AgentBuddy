// `declaredTypeOf` is what lets a plugin's contract be a type rather than a value carrying phantom properties.

 * import `@not/installed` are unaffected by the sharing: the reader queries the checker and never reads its
 * diagnostics, so an unresolved import in one module is invisible to the rest.
 *
 * `__generated__/` is deliberately absent, which is what a pack's own tree looks like before codegen has run once.

 * build nothing under `#generated/` resolves: `actions/fe/contract.ts` has `categories: Category` from
 * `#generated/types.ts` in its state and `actionId: EARS.EntityId` in its events, both `any` at that moment, and
