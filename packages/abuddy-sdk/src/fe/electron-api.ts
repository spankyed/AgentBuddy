/**
 * **The whole bridge, which is the one declaration of it.**
 *
 * `packages/preload` builds an object and asserts it `satisfies` this, so the compiler holds the exposed
 * surface and the declared one to each other in both directions: a member exposed and not declared is an
 * excess property, and one declared and not exposed is a missing one. Without it the two drift, and what
 * pack code then reaches for is `(window as any)`.
 *
 * **`Window.electronAPI` is a view of this, not this**: `PackFacingBridge` below drops the two members a
 * window has and pack authors are not pointed at. Host code that needs one of those takes this type.
 *
 * **Host-only, and the underscore is what makes that checkable.** Publishing the whole bridge under a
 * pack-facing name would point pack authors at `apiToken` through a different door than the one the
 * pack-facing view closes; `check:specifiers` refuses pack code importing an `_`-prefixed export, so this
 * is a boundary something enforces rather than an omission nothing does.
