// manifest could describe, so nothing could derive that they compile this file

/**
 * What hands a plugin's handlers the answer for the message being handled — the same wrapper a system's
 * `defineSystem` gives, over a machine's own context and events.
 *
 * Re-exported here because `@abuddy/sdk/framework` is **not** in `SDK_FE_MODULES`
 * (`@abuddy/host/build/shared-deps`): a pack frontend can import its types but cannot load it at runtime, so
 * without this a pack's plugin could be handed no `reply` and the frontend half of answering would exist for
 * host code alone. One implementation serves both sides — `define-system.ts` imports only xstate types,
 * `safeEvents`, `eventTypes` and `@abuddy/sdk/events`, all frontend-safe.
 *
 * A plugin's `reply` is the open form, and that is right rather than a gap: a plugin's contract declares the
 * state it publishes and the inbox it opens, not an outgoing union, so there is nothing to bound it by. A
 * system's is bound by its contract's `outgoing`.
