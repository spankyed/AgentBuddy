 * One feature, both halves, each naming an entry and a contract — which is what makes a rule about contracts
 * able to fire. Which module is a contract is what `abuddy.json` says, not what a file looks like, so a fixture
 * without a manifest is one several pack rules cannot speak about at all.
 *
 * **The feature id is deliberately not one `@app/default-setup` has.** It was `notes`, which that pack really
 * ships, so `src/features/notes/` named a fixture's invention and a real feature at once — in a grep, in a
 * failure message, and in a spec that writes a path meant to read as the real pack's (`findRepositoryCasts`
 * does, a few hundred lines into `import-specifiers.integration.spec.ts`). Keep it a name no pack takes.

/**
 * A pack on disk, complete by default: both subpath maps, a manifest declaring a feature's two halves, and the
 * files those paths name.
 *
 * **It is a helper, and the preamble is what it saves.** Eleven specs wrote some version of `mkdtemp`, a
 * manifest, a `package.json` and a symlinked `node_modules` before getting to what they were about, and four
 * of them wrote that symlink identically. Complete *by default* is a convenience on top: a case that adds one
 * offending file gets a tree where every rule can speak, so it does not have to think about which parts of a
 * pack a rule needs.
 *
 * **It is not what catches a fixture too thin for a rule to fire** — that reading of it is how a mandate gets
 * built on top, and one was. `import-specifiers.integration.spec.ts` asserts per rule that it *found something
 * in a tree written to offend it*, so a rule that cannot fire fails loudly, naming itself, whatever wrote the
 * tree. That assertion landed in `1ee9b5a4c` on 2026-09-27, five days before this fixture existed, and it is
 * the mechanism. A check sweeping every spec for hand-written manifests was a second record of the same fact
 * and is deleted (`487a8c115`); if a thin fixture is ever the worry again, the answer is an assertion in the
 * spec that would be wrong, not a rule about how other specs write files.
 *
 * **It sits in a published package and is unreachable from outside it**, as `@abuddy/sdk/testing/pack-fixture`:
 * an entry whose only branch is `@abuddy/source`, which `publishedManifest` drops from the published manifest
 * outright. So nothing can resolve the specifier — not a consumer of the tarball, which has no such entry, and
 * not a pack, whose config may not declare that condition (`check:specifiers`). It appears in no `etc/*.api.md`
 * either, so `api:check` does not review it. `./runtime/internals` is the same shape.
 *
 * **What that shape does not buy, measured rather than assumed, because the first draft claimed otherwise.**
 * The compiled file *ships*: `files` is `["dist", …]`, and `publish/dist/testing/pack-fixture.{js,d.ts}` are in
 * the staged tree, as `runtime/internals`' are — dropping the entry hides it, it does not leave it out.
 * Deliberately not exported from `testing/index.ts`, which is published.
 *
 * **The condition that would make it public API: a published pack-reading API.** Today every consumer of a pack
 * directory is private — the pack rules and the source parser are `@abuddy/cli`'s, which publishes no
 * declarations, and the layout, subpath-imports and own-module-specifier readers are the private
 * `@abuddy/host`'s. A fixture for tooling nobody outside can import has no user outside, and a pack author
 * tests their own pack, which is already a directory (`PACK_DIR`), or their pack's code through
 * `setupPackTests`, which takes a registration rather than a tree. Publish any of that pack-reading surface and
 * this should go public in the same change; until then publishing it would fix the default manifest's shape,
 * the `manifest`/`rawManifest` split and these stub files as contract — and the default is chosen to make
 * *this repo's* pack rules fire, which is the wrong promise to make to anyone else.
 *
 * **It makes a pack's *source* tree and stops there.** Building one is `buildPack(dir)` and installing one is
 * the installer's own helper: composition, not options, because both already take a directory. A `built: true`
 * option was considered and dropped for that reason — it would own a second way to call something that works.
 * The *installed* shape (a manifest beside `integrity.json`, a snapshot and `dist/runtime`) is a different
 * artifact whose layout `@abuddy/host` owns (`PACK_LAYOUT`), and host's own tests build it in host, where the
 * layer rule keeps it.
