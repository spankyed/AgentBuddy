// What each of the repo's value-serialising passes decided, as data.
//
// Five passes turn an arbitrary runtime value into something storable or sendable, and they differ — mostly on
// purpose. `docs/reference/value-serialisation.md` explains why; this is the same answers in a form the specs
// can check, so a cell cannot drift from the code it describes.
//
// **Why it is data here rather than one spec somewhere.** The passes live in `@app/api`, `@abuddy/cli` and
// `@abuddy/sdk`, and no package may import all three: `@app/repo-checks` is allowed `@abuddy/sdk` and
// `@abuddy/host` only. So the matrix is declared once and asserted from the three suites that can each reach
// their own, which between them cover all five rows.
//
// **Source-only export**, the shape `./testing/pack-fixture` uses: the `exports` entry names a path under
// `@abuddy/source` and nothing else, so `publishedManifest` drops it and no pack can resolve it. This is
// repo-internal test data, not something a pack author materialises.
//
// Depth is deliberately not a column. The caps are 10 (`truncateResult`), 50 (`redactSecrets`) and none (the
// encoder, which catches the stack overflow instead), so one input cannot ask all five the same question —
// each pass's own spec covers its cap.
