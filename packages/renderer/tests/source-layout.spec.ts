// The renderer is a shell around @abuddy/host, and its folders are the jobs it does: `boot/` starts the window,
// `runtime/` makes this window's resources and binds the frontend port, `transport/` is the wire to the API,
// `adapters/` implements the ports the host's machines take, and `views/` renders. The API's tree says the same of
// itself (`packages/api/tests/source-layout.spec.ts`), so the two read alike and a concept found in one is
// looked for in the same place in the other.
//
// A folder named for a layer rather than a job — core, shared, lib, utils, common, helpers — takes whatever nobody
// placed, which is how `core/` came to hold the client, the binding, the toast, the types and the layout components
// at once. This says a new file belongs to one of the five jobs, so where it goes is a question with an answer.
