// The protocol a live drive session speaks, against a fake page. What is checked here is that every verb
// answers rather than throws, and that the two things the real app would make expensive to discover —
// a result that cannot cross the process boundary, and two bus round-trips sharing an answer that names
// neither — are handled before anything launches Electron.
//
// The correlation is the envelope's call: an ask carries `Message.call` and its answer `Message.answering`,
// so `answer` names the call it answers and the bridge path builds the same thing with `answerTo`, which is
// what a window's delivery door puts on the event. Nothing is in the event itself, which is why these cases
// read the call off the send rather than out of a payload.
