 * body into an `__init` the bundle calls on first use, so default-setup's `extensions/steps/action/runtime.ts`
 * runs its `require('@apack/sdk/logger')` when an action step first runs — any time, under any stack. A
 * scoped patch is gone by then, and priming the cache cannot cover it: Node resolves before it looks in the
 * cache, and an installed pack has no `node_modules` for a bare specifier to resolve through. In a checkout
 * the workspace one sits above the pack and answers, which is why this is invisible until a pack is
 * installed — and then every action step fails with `Cannot find module '@apack/sdk/logger'`.
 *
 * **Resolution only, and it never throws.** `withModuleBridge`'s refusals are load-time diagnostics — they
 * tell a pack author to rebuild, at the moment the pack's runtime is being required — so they stay scoped to
 * that load. Keeping them installed would make them answer for host code too, and `appOnly` would then
 * refuse the app its own `@apack/ears/lmdb`.
 *
 * Safe to leave installed because the only CJS `require` of a bridged specifier in this process is a pack's:
 * host code is ESM, which never consults `Module._resolveFilename`, and the API bundle inlines these packages
 * rather than requiring them. Idempotent, since every pack load asks for the same host.
