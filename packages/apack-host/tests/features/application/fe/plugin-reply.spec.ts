// A surface answers whoever asked it, and the channel depends on where that asker is.
//
// This is the window's half of `tests/bus/reply.spec.ts`, which covers the backend's. Until 2026-10-06 there was
// nothing to cover: `sendToSurfaceActor` opened a delivery naming only the surface, so every one of its nine call
// sites handed a surface's handler `reply: undefined` — including `connection.ts`, where the asking system's ref
// had arrived on the wire and was destructured away.
//
// Two askers can reach a surface and they are answered through different channels, which is the whole subject:
// a **backend system** is answered out over this window's connection, and a **surface in this window** is
// answered beside it, never touching the bus. A bare ref cannot tell them apart, since a feature's system and
// surface share one — so `_Asker` carries the way back, and the `does not go out onto the bus` case is what
// fails if that distinction is ever collapsed.
