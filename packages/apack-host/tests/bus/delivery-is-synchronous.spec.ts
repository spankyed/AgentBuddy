// The delivery scope lasts exactly as long as the call that delivers the message, and no longer.
//
// That is a decision, not a limitation left in place. It was an `AsyncLocalStorage` while `reply()` read the
// scope at the moment it was called, because a backend handler routinely answers after an `await`. A handler
// is handed its answer now — built synchronously as the handler is entered — so nothing reads the scope late,
// and the store bought one thing it should not have: anything the handler *created* inherited it, a timer
// included, so a send made minutes later carried an asker who had long stopped waiting.
//
// This file is what keeps the limit honest. Without it the next person to make a handler `await` before
// sending would find the sender missing and read it as a bug rather than as the shape.
