// A system can ask one window as well as all of them, which is the other half of being answerable.
//
// `reply` let a window answer a system. Asking was still a broadcast, so one question collected one answer
// per open window — the system got N replies to a thing it asked once. `sendToWindow` addresses one
// connection instead, and the connection is **given** to it: a handler is handed the window it is serving
// (`client`, beside `reply`), which is what lets the address outlive an `await`.
//
// The pair is the subject. `broadcastToPlugin` is news every window needs; `sendToWindow` is for what only
// the window that asked should act on, and the cases below are the same send differing in `Message.client`.
//
// Which window a handler is *handed* is `apack-sdk`'s `define-system-actions.spec.ts`; this file is what
// the send does with one.
