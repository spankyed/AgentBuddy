/**
 * What `npm run packages:check` decides to run (`scripts/lib/packages-check-plan.ts`).
 *
 * **The load-bearing claim is that `attw` never gets a directory.** `attw --pack <dir>` runs `npm pack` inside
 * the tree it is checking and deletes the tarball afterwards, which is a file appearing and vanishing under
 * every other step that reads there — the recorded `ENOENT: open 'publish/abuddy-ui-0.1.0.tgz'`. Keeping other
 * steps away from it instead was a mutex against 29 of the chain's 30 steps.
 *
 * Asked of the plan rather than of a run, because a run is 2s a tree and 7.8s for all five (measured
 * 2026-10-08) and the step is checked by the chain anyway. What a tarball packed this way does to the tree it
 * came from is `@abuddy/host`'s `published-manifest.spec.ts`, over `packTree` itself.
