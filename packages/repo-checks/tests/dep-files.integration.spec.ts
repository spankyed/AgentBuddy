 * **module graph** is `suite-reads` walking a suite's specs, which is a declaration checked against
 * another declaration. And for the rest there is **nothing per-step**: builds, shell scenarios and
 * Playwright runs have no tool that reports their reads, and syscall tracing was reasoned out of scope
 * (`docs/archive/plans/one-action-cache.md`) because it cannot tell a read that matters from a stat
 * during module resolution.
 *
 * Those nine are covered only by `chain-inputs`' coverage question — every tracked file is *some* step's
 * input — which cannot catch a step declaring too little. That is a real gap and this is a record of it,
 * not a gate over it: the list is asserted so it cannot drift in prose, so a step gaining observation
 * shows up, and so a new step that nothing watches has to be added here deliberately.

   * **Two kinds of entry sit in this list, and the difference is the whole of what to do about them.**
   * Measured 2026-10-02, because the distinction keeps being re-derived.
   *
   * *No tool can report on it.* The two packaged-authoring halves are five `npm pack`s and two
   * `npm install`s into a temp tree outside the monorepo — a package manager writes no dep file, and
   * resolving from the published tarballs is the thing they exist to prove. There is nothing to build here,
   * and what protects them instead is that their inputs are **derived** (`PACKAGE_BUILD_OUTPUTS`,
   * `APP_OUTPUTS`) rather than hand-listed, which is the only protection available to a step nothing can
   * observe. `build:app` has one leg that derivation does not reach — it compiles the built-in pack's own
   * sources into the renderer and the api, which no output of another step covers — so that leg is
   * hand-listed and `chain-inputs.spec.ts` asserts it, which is the third kind of protection and the one to
   * reach for when a step reads something nothing writes. Two entries because the check is two steps, split at the app boundary. `test:smoke` and
   * `test` are the same shape: Playwright driving a real Electron process.
   *
   * *A tool could report, and two now are asked.* `compile` and `test:external-pack:contract` both run
   * `abuddy build`, which records what each bundling phase read — the describe above reads it. Measured
   * 2026-10-02 on its first run: 285 files for `compile`, 131 of them `@abuddy/sdk`'s and `@abuddy/ears`'
   * published `dist`, which `PACKAGE_BUILD_OUTPUTS` already declared. So it confirmed the declaration
   * rather than finding a hole, which is what a gate over a correct declaration is supposed to do.
   *
   * **Both steps stay on this list, and that is why the distinction is written down rather than inferred
   * from a column.** What is observed is the bundling. Codegen, the tsx-loaded content compilation, the
   * feature settings load and the static pack rules have no bundler to ask. So moving either step out of
   * this list would make it read as verified over part of its work, which is the same judgement the
   * paragraph below makes about the cheap route.
   *
   * `facade:check` is here for the neighbouring reason: it re-bundles the facade through rollup and
   * compares, and records nothing, because a dep file is written where output is committed and a check
   * commits none. Its inputs are declared by hand rather than derived, which is what stands in its place.
   *
   * **The cheap version of that route is a trap**, which is why it is named rather than left to be found:
   * those fixture packs also run `tsc --noEmit`, so giving *their* tsconfigs a `tsBuildInfoFile` would put
   * this step in the observed column while observing 2.5s of its 57s. A step reading as verified over 4% of
   * its work is worse than one honestly listed here.

/**
 * **What a bundle read, against what its build unit declares.**
 *
 * The third thing this repo can observe, after the compilers' dep files and `abuddy build`'s module graphs —
 * and the one whose absence cost a real defect. `@abuddy/cli` and `@abuddy/testing` are bundled by esbuild
 * with `@abuddy/host` *and* the shared-instance packages inlined **from source**, and `bundled()` declared
 * only the first. So an edit to `@abuddy/sdk/src` left both bundles stale with their stamps reading fresh,
 * `packages:ensure` rebuilt nothing, and it surfaced only when a packaged-authoring run type-checked a
 * generated file against an SDK whose type no longer matched the CLI that emitted it.
 *
 * No other input check could see it. `chain-table`'s closure walk follows a build *script's* own imports, and
 * the bundler reaches these through the package being bundled; everything else compares one declaration
 * against another. This compares a declaration against an observation, which is the only kind that can catch
 * a read nobody modelled.
 *
 * The record is never a cache key — `bundleReadsFile`'s comment has why: last run's reads cannot invalidate
 * on a file that was not read last time, which is this same defect wearing a different hat.
