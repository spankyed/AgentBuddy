/**
 * A spec lives with the thing it can break.
 *
 * The rule this repo already applies to repositories and migrations, checked for specs. Two ways it fails,
 * and they have different causes:
 *
 * - **A package has source and no suite.** Then there is nowhere for its specs to be, so they end up in a
 *   neighbour — and `npm run spec`, which asks which package a changed file belongs to, finds nothing to
 *   run. `@abuddy/testing` and `@abuddy/ui` were in this state: six specs about them lived in `@abuddy/cli`,
 *   and asking for the specs covering `@abuddy/testing/src/launch-env.ts` did not report "none", it crashed
 *   in vitest's project resolution, because with no config of its own vitest walked up to the root one and
 *   resolved its `projects` list against the wrong directory.
 * - **A spec reaches into another package's tree.** The assertion is right and the location is not, so a
 *   failure points at the wrong package and a rename in one breaks a suite in another.
 *
 * Neither is a mistake anyone makes on purpose; both are what a package extraction leaves behind when the
 * tests do not follow it. Every one this repo has done — `@abuddy/host` out of the api, `@abuddy/testing`,
 * `@abuddy/ui`, `@app/repo-checks` — left some, and nothing noticed any of them. That is what these two
 * checks are for: not to find today's, which `goal-test-placement.md` moved, but to fail on the next one.
 *
 * The repo's own `scripts/` is the other half of this and lives in `repo-check-boundary.spec.ts`; between
 * them every tree a spec can reach across is covered.
