/**
 * A suite declares the files its specs load.
 *
 * `chain-inputs.spec.ts` asks the coverage question — every tracked file is *some* step's input — and that
 * leaves the per-suite one unasked: does this suite declare what this suite reads. Three defects in one
 * week were that gap, each found by accident rather than by a check: `test:smoke` cached stale over the
 * bundle it drives, the repo-wide guards ran against 13% of their subject, and a doc a spec asserts sat in
 * no step's inputs.
 *
 * The consequence is specific and quiet. A suite's project is re-run when *its* declared inputs move
 * (`poolUnitFor`, `scripts/lib/unit-pool.ts`), so a spec that imports a file nobody declared keeps its last
 * result while that file changes. Measured on the two this found: touching
 * `packages/abuddy-ui/src/tailwind-preset.ts` left `@abuddy/cli`'s project not stale, and the spec that
 * imports it did not re-run.
 *
 * **Relative imports only**, which is what `reachableFrom` follows. A bare `@abuddy/…` specifier is covered
 * instead by `workspaceDeps` reading the manifest, so this compares a graph against a declaration *and*
 * another declaration rather than against an observation — worth knowing before trusting it as proof. What
 * it cannot see at all is a path built at runtime: the repo-wide guards ask git what the tree holds, which
 * `SUITE_READS.repo` declares and `fingerprint-scope.spec.ts` holds to the specs that do it.

/**
 * What a declared input holds, read once per path however many questions ask about it.
 *
 * Not a convenience: both sides of the second case below expand declared paths, and a chain run has another
 * lane writing into each fixture pack's `dist` under `tests/packs` while this one runs. Taken as two walks, the suite's side saw three
 * fixture build outputs the step's side had walked a moment earlier and missed, and the case reported the step
 * as declaring less than its suite reads — the defect it exists to find, over a difference that was only the
 * clock. Measured 2026-10-01 in a chain where `test:external-pack:contract` wrote them at the moment this ran.
 *
 * One reading, so a verdict and the tree it is about are the same tree.
