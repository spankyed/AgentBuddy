 * was blind to the rest of the tree: `@abuddy/sdk`'s suite was an input to 241 of 1860 tracked code files.
 * It missed a forbidden path committed to `@abuddy/cli`, which is not one of its dependencies, and two full
 * chain runs passed over it. `SUITE_READS`' `repo` flag is the fix; this is what keeps it applied.
 *
 * The subject is derived from the specs themselves, through the AST: a spec that calls `repoFiles` is
 * asking what the repo holds, whatever it then does with the answer. That one call is the whole signal
 * because `check:specifiers`' `findRawGitListings` refuses a spec that asks git directly, so `repoFiles`
 * is the only way left to ask — and matching the string `ls-files` too made this file look like one.
