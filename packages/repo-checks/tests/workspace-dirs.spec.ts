 * What "the workspaces" means, and what happens to a glob that does not fit it.
 *
 * `PACKAGE_DIRS` is the one definition — `chain-steps.ts` turns it into every step's inputs, and four specs
 * read it — and it refuses a `workspaces` entry whose workspaces it could not name, because the alternative
 * is dropping them and reporting green over the difference. That refusal runs at module load of something
 * both `npm run chain` and `npm run spec` import, so it can only be watched failing from a pure function,
 * which is why `workspaceDirsFrom` is one.
