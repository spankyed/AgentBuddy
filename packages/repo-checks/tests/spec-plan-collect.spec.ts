// The one case in `spec-plan`'s subject that starts a vitest of its own: asking the run the planner chose to
// collect, and checking that what comes back is from the root the planner picked.
//
// Its own file because of what it costs, not what it does. Beside `spec-plan`'s 112 pure cases this one
// subprocess put that file across the cost band — 2.8s measured in the fast half, 1.4s in the slow one, so
// the gate asked for a move in both directions at once. Alone it is a second, which is a fast spec that
// happens to spawn: the halves are about cost, and this case is cheap enough for either.
