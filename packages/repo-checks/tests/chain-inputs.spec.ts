// it covers five packages whose builds read their own trees — where a chain step reads whatever its script
// happens to reach, which is not visible from the step's name.
//
// It asks git rather than walking the tree, so an ignored file is not mistaken for an untracked source, and
// resolves a step's inputs through `inputFiles` — the walk a fingerprint is taken over — so the guard and
// the cache key cannot disagree about what an input covers.
//
// `BUILD_UNITS` gets the same treatment at the bottom of this file, and used to be excused from it here on
// the grounds that it "covers five packages whose builds read their own trees". That was not true: a build
// script imports modules, and three units were missing the one their staging is derived from.

   * A linter walks a directory, so the files it reads are not the files its command names — `oxlint .` names one
   * path and reads a hundred. `reachableText` answers what a script *names*, which is the right answer to its own
   * question and no answer to this one, so the case above sees nothing here: it also cannot follow into
   * `TYPECHECK_LEGS`, because the legs are data this imports rather than text a script spells.
   *
   * Measured before this existed: the root `lint:check` grew from `oxlint scripts tests` to `oxlint .` minus two
   * directories, which took in three packaging modules that `typecheck` did not declare — so an unused binding in
   * `build/prod/diagnostics.mjs` failed `lint:check` while the chain planned `typecheck` as cached.
   *
   * `lint:check` lints in two passes and both are derived here. The root one is `oxlint .` minus `docs/**` and
   * the CLI's scaffold templates (`lint-scope.spec.ts` holds that second exclusion, which nothing else reads —
   * this case does not, because `typecheck` declares `templates` among its inputs whether it is linted or not);
   * the other is the script run in each workspace, from that package's directory — which is why a
   * target resolves against a base rather than the repo root. Expanding a script's text is not enough to see the
   * second: the root script's own first clause *is* the fan-out, and `expanded` substitutes each `npm run` once,
   * so the workspace passes stayed invisible and a package-root `.mjs` no step declared went unnoticed until
   * someone read the command by hand.
   *
   * Everything a pass depends on is derived from the thing that decides it, because a pass this cannot see is a
   * pass nothing checks and there is no assertion that catches the *absence* of one. So the workspaces come from
   * the root `workspaces` field rather than a listing of `packages/` that agrees with it today, and both
   * spellings of the fan-out are followed — `-ws` over all of them and `-w <name>` over the ones it names.
   *
   * Derived from the command, not restated: the targets and the `--ignore-pattern`s are parsed out of the same
   * string the leg runs, so narrowing the lint scope narrows what this demands. A shape it cannot read fails
   * rather than passing over whatever it did not understand. The one thing it reads and discards is
   * `--ignore-path .gitignore`, because everything it considers comes from `git ls-files` and a gitignored file
   * is not tracked; any other ignore file is exclusions it cannot account for, and fails.
   *
   * The renderer's `&& eslint .` half is not derived — its ignores live in `eslint.config.ts`, not in the
   * command — and it needs no derivation: it walks the tree the oxlint call in that same script already covers.

 * pack's generated FE entry and the api's tsup traces the BE one, so a bundler walks into the pack's `src`
 * where `reachableText` sees `tsx scripts/build-app.ts` and nothing else. The coverage case at the top of this
 * file cannot see it either: `packages/default-setup/src` is `compile`'s input, so the tree is covered
 * repo-wide while the other step that compiles it declares none of it.
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-07, before this existed. One `.vue` edit under the pack, one `compile`, and `chain --dry`
 * reported `build:app` **cached** — `PACK_OUTPUTS` carries the pack's `dist`, which holds no frontend bundle
 * for a built-in pack, and `src/__generated__`, whose only file that moves on such an edit is the
 * dot-prefixed `.inputs-hash` that `inputFiles` skips. The app that `test:smoke` and the two packaged suites
 * then drove had never held the change, which is the sibling rule's sentence again: a gate that skips when the
 * thing it drives has changed is not a gate.
 *
 * **The subject is files rather than the `src` directory**, because a step that keeps the declaration and
 * narrows its key with `excludeSuffixes` — which `api:check` does, for a measured saving — would satisfy a
 * directory check and cache past the files anyway. `coveredBy` honours that field; `fingerprinted`
