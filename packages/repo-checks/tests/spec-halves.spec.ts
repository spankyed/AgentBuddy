// The half a spec runs in, and the two walks that find the specs to begin with.
//
// **Written against a planted tree rather than this repo, because the thing most worth checking cannot be
// seen from here.** `specFiles` walks a package whole, `src/` included, and that reach is a net for a
// spec no config would collect — every include is `tests/**`. No package colocates one today, so the
// reach has no live subject, and narrowing the walk to `tests/` left the entire suite green: the case
// that looked like its protection (`spec-placement.spec.ts`' "reports a spec colocated in src/") hands
// `uncollected` a path *string*, so it proves the rule classifies such a path and says nothing about
// whether anything would ever find the file. A fixture is the only way to ask the walk itself.
//
// `specFilesUnder` (`test-timeouts.ts`) is the second walk and had no spec either. Its case here records
// what it does rather than what one might want it to do — see the describe.
