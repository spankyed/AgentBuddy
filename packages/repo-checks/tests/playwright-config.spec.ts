 * answered and the Playwright half was not. There were six of these: the repo's own E2E config, the one
 * `apack init-tests` scaffolds, both fixture packs', and the drive layer's two — and the repo's own had
 * already drifted to a `use` block giving it screenshots and traces that the three packs' lacked. Nobody
 * decided that; it is what six copies do.
 *
 * One helper per kind of run (`@apack/testing/playwright`), because a setting means something different
 * to each: an E2E suite has a budget to hold, a driving run has no timeout at all because someone is
 * watching it, and a serving session has four settings its HTTP handshake depends on.
