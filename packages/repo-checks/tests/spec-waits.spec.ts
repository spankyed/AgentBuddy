// A spec may wait for something to have happened. It may not assert how long that takes.
//
// A sleep puts a guess about duration into every passing run, and when the guess is short the failure reads
// exactly like the bug it was meant to catch — "no answer arrived" — which buys an investigation every time it
// fires. `@apack/sdk/testing/waiting` is the alternative and its header carries the rule: a wait is driven by
// the thing it waits for and names what never happened. An event where there is one; a poll where there is none,
// as `apack-host/tests/database/write-lock.spec.ts` does for a file lock. A bare duration is never the answer.
//
// This exists because sixteen of them grew up on one branch, not through carelessness: the only event-driven
// waiter was private to the test harness, so at the point of need a sleep was the cheapest thing available.
// Making the right thing the cheapest thing is what the shared waiter did; this is what stops the count going
// back up.
//
// **Two things the mechanism gets right that a text scan cannot**, both measured on this repo. A third of the
// textual matches for a delayed `setTimeout` are inside string literals — subprocess bodies, an `actionFn`, a
// script the CLI runs — and all nine are correctly ignored here. And a `setTimeout` that calls `reject` is a
// kill deadline, which is the thing being promoted, so only a timer reaching the promise's own `resolve`
// counts. `scripts/lib/test-timeouts.ts` has both rules, and the module's header records the regex attempts
// that failed in both directions before it read the tree.
