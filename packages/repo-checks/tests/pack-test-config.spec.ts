/**
 * A pack's vitest config is a call to `definePackTestConfig`, not a copy of one.
 *
 * There were three of these and they had drifted: the built-in pack, the repo's fixture pack and the config
 * `abuddy init` scaffolds each restated the same settings, and one ran without `globals` while another set
 * it. Nobody decided that; it is what three copies do, and a fourth copy is a `cp` away — which is why this
 * is a check and not a convention.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately blunt: **call the helper, and declare no `test` block of your own.** Everything a
 * pack needs is an option (`dataDirPrefix`, `exclude`, `plugins`, `setupFiles`, `vue`), so a `test` block
 * means the pack has stopped delegating — and an exception below then records which pack had to escape and
 * why, which is the part worth knowing.
