/**
 * **The devex requirement of [`goal-one-kind-of-pack`](../../../docs/archive/goals/goal-one-kind-of-pack.md): from
 * `npm run start`, editing a `.vue` in *any* workspace pack patches the component rather than reloading the
 * window.** It outranked every other consideration in that goal, and nothing else here would notice it
 * going: the app would still boot, every pack would still load, and a component edit would quietly start
 * costing the app's state.
 *
 * What makes it true is one structural fact, which is what this asserts: the pack's modules are in the
 * renderer dev server's **own** module graph, so Vite has a self-accepting module with importers to stop the
 * update at. `virtual:dev-pack-frontends` is the mechanism — it statically names each local pack's generated
 * frontend entry, and the entry imports the pack's components. A pack fetched over `pack://` is outside that
 * graph entirely, which is why a component edit there reloads the window instead (measured 2026-10-07, and
 * recorded where `apack dev` prints it).
 *
 * The graph is walked from the real entry rather than by requesting the pack's file directly, because what
 * is being checked is that *the page reaches it*: a module transformed on its own is in the graph with no
 * importers, which is not the condition HMR needs and not what a browser does.
 *
 * What is **not** here: which payload Vite then sends. That is Vite's and plugin-vue's behaviour over a
 * self-accepting module, identical for every module in the graph, and asserting it would be testing Vite.
 * The map's own contents — which packs are in it, and why a directory is not — are `@apack/host`'s
 * `tests/build/dev-pack-frontends.spec.ts`, where they cost nothing.
