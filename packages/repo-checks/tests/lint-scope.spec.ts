// The lint gate's one exclusion, and whether anything holds it there.
//
// `lint:check` lints `packages/` since 8549f81a5, with a single exclusion: the CLI's scaffold templates. Their
// parameter names are what a pack author reads when they open their first action, so `params`, `services`, `z`
// and `flowId` are documentation there rather than unused bindings.
//
// That exclusion is a pattern in `package.json`, and before this spec nothing read it. The failure it prevents is
// not hypothetical — it happened, in this order: the templates' four parameters were renamed to `_params`,
// `_services`, `_z`, `_flowId`, taking oxlint's own advice ("Unused parameters should start with a '_'"); that
// broke `add-extensions.integration.spec.ts` and the chain, and shipped a scaffold whose whole API surface was
// underscore-prefixed in a repo where `_` means @internal and host-only; it was reverted; then the exclusion was
// added. `chain-inputs.spec.ts` does not catch a deletion of it, because `typecheck` declares `templates` among
// its inputs either way.
