// Whether a decision in `scripts/lib/` can be observed at all — by the cases that cover it, or by anything.
//
// Root CLAUDE.md already says a mutation check is worth more than a re-run, and two cases shipped under that
// rule that could not see what they claimed to cover: one watching `settle`'s `skipped` comparison also moved
// a cost, so removing the comparison left every case green; one watching `absentNamed`'s sort derived its two
// suites as the first two `UNIT_SUITES` entries, which are already in alphabetical order, so sorted and
// unsorted output were the same list. Both were found by breaking the source on purpose, and that evidence
// then existed only in a commit message.
//
// So it lives here instead. Each entry breaks one line of the module and calls the same function on the same
// input as the real one: **the two answers must differ.** An entry that stops differing is a decision nothing
// can observe any more, which is the state both of those cases were in.
//
// Be exact about what that buys, because the neighbouring claim is the tempting one and it is false: this
// pins a discriminating input per decision, so a decision cannot be deleted in silence. It does **not** police
// whether the cases in `suite-split.spec.ts` use a discriminating input — their inputs are their own, and what
// keeps that one honest is its own assertion that the answer differs from the order it passed in. Sharing the
// fixtures between the two files would close that, and is the next step if this is ever worth extending.
//
// It covers the breaks the table lists and no others: it makes today's evidence permanent rather than going
// looking for tomorrow's.
//
// **Five modules, and what qualifies one is reachability rather than subject.** It began as one, grew to two
// when the sample-recording primitives moved to `measure.ts`, and took `step-timeouts.ts`,
// `chain-schedule.ts` and `core-budget.ts` when the hand-run version of this ritual was retired: copy the
// file, edit it, run a
// filtered command, read the output, restore. That has three independent ways to lie — a restore that takes
// the index rather than your work, a run that does not run, and a filter that hides the answer — and two of
// the three were observed in one session. Here there is nothing to restore, the suite cannot skip it, and a
// non-discriminating entry *fails*, which the ritual could never do. `docs/archive/plans/vacuous-assertions.md` records why a firing case per check is a
// larger programme than this.
