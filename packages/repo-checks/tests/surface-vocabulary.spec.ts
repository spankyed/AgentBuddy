/**
 * A feature's frontend half is a **surface** and its backend half a **system**. `plugin` names an
 * editor plugin (tiptap/ProseMirror), a bundler plugin (Vite, rollup, PostCSS, esbuild) or a plugin of
 * a third-party CLI this app drives, and nothing else. This guard keeps those vocabularies apart from
 * the concept now that they live side by side.
 *
 * Here and not in `@apackdev/host`, because its subject is every tracked file and not one package. A
 * suite's project is re-run when that project's inputs move, so a guard over the repo has to sit in a
 * suite that declares the repo (`SUITE_READS`' `repo`); in a package suite it would miss a name
 * committed anywhere else, which is how `identity-guard` passed two chain runs over a violation in
 * `@apackdev/cli`.
 *
 * **The patterns are the whole of the rule, and `KEPT` is what makes them trustworthy.** A pattern
 * written to catch `Plugin` is one character away from catching `TiptapPlugin`, which is published API
 * — so every group is asserted to match the names it retires *and* to leave every kept spelling alone.
 * Those two cases are live from the moment this lands; the scan over the tree is what waits.

 * Policing that costs an `ALLOWED` row per rename that can never be removed, and whose staleness case can
