/**
 * A leg's scope comes from its script, and a declared one has something the script cannot say.
 *
 * This was the other way round until 2026-10: every leg declared a scope and this file held the
 * declaration to the script. Twelve of the eighteen declarations turned out to be byte-identical to what
 * the script already named — a second record of one fact, which is what the derived chain graph exists to
 * remove. So the parse became the source and the declarations went.
 *
 * What is checked now is the shape of the exception rather than the rule: that nothing declares a list the
 * script would have given anyway, that nothing is left without either, and that a declaration names real
 * workspaces.
