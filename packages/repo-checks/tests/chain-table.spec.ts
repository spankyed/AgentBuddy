/**
 * The rungs whose stretch factor is a borrow, against the prose that tells a person which they are.
 *
 * `ASSUMED_RUNGS` (`step-timeouts.ts`) is derived from the table and is therefore always right. Nothing
 * held the prose to it, and the prose went stale inside a day: `ci.yml`'s header said enabling CI would
 * validate *one* of the two borrowed rows, when `scripts/bounded.ts` is a second path into the ladder and
 * CI's `external-pack-e2e` job bounds at `scenario` through it — so **both** are reached. `5300582c3`
 * corrected that in eight paths and missed a ninth.
 *
 * **This header and not the other five restatements.** It is the only one outside source, so no reader of
 * the code passes it on the way, and it is what a person reads when deciding whether to switch the triggers
 * on — the moment the claim is acted on rather than skimmed. The five in source sit beside the derivation
 * and move with it under review.
 *
 * One direction, as the flags check below takes: every assumed rung must be named. The header may also name
 * a measured one — it does, to say `suite` is the row nothing waits on — and a check that could not tell
 * that from a stale entry would have to read prose for intent.
 *
 * **So it catches omission and not denial, which is worth knowing before trusting it.** A substring match
 * sees that a rung is mentioned, never what is claimed about it: it would have caught the header that named
 * `quick` alone, and it would pass "enabling this settles `quick` and not `scenario`", which names both and
 * is as wrong. Telling those apart means reading the sentence for intent, which is the line this does not
 * cross — the header is prose for a person and a check that parsed it would be a second author. What stands
 * behind the gap is review, and the derivation itself: `ASSUMED_RUNGS` cannot be wrong about the population,
 * so a denial here is a reader's error about a list that is right rather than a stale list.
