 * noticed, because a dead link in a markdown file fails nothing.
 *
 * The docs are where this repo keeps the reasoning behind decisions — the chain's tiers, the seams, what each
 * measurement disproved — and a doc reached by following a link from another is how any of that is found. A
 * link that 404s costs the reader the chain of reasoning, silently.
