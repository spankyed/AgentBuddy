// What a step's command reaches, which is read by a cache key and by a safety scan.
//
// `reachableText` has two consumers and they fail differently: `commandText` turns its `invoked` set into
// part of every step's fingerprint, where being wrong is **silent**, and `check:tiers` searches its `text`
// for the ways this repo launches the app, where being wrong is a finding someone reads. So the set it
// returns is worth asserting directly rather than through either.
//
// The scanner is given synthetic script maps here. `workspaceScripts` reads the real `packages/` tree, so a
// made-up workspace resolves to no body — which is immaterial: what these cases are about is *which* script
// each call is attributed to, and that is `invoked`.
