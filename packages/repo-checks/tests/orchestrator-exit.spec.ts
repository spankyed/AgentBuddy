// A script that captures a child's output and reprints it must not call `process.exit()`.
//
// `process.exit()` abandons whatever stdout has still to flush. Measured: piped, it delivers 64KB of a
// 500KB write, and `@app/default-setup`'s suite output alone is 654KB — so a failing step's captured
// output, the one thing worth reading, is what gets cut. This has now been introduced twice: once in
// `scripts/test-unit.ts`, fixed with a comment explaining it, and then again in `scripts/chain.ts` by
// someone who had read that comment. A third time is a rule, not a review note.
//
// The rule is narrow on purpose. `process.exit()` is fine in a script that printed a line and stops, and
// most of `scripts/` is that. What makes it dangerous is reprinting a captured buffer, and the scripts that
// do that are exactly the ones importing `boundedSpawn` — which is derivable rather than listed.
