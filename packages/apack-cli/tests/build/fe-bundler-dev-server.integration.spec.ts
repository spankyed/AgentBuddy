/**
 * **The dev server is a second context for this plugin, and it can disagree with a build.**
 *
 * `apack dev` serves a pack's frontend from `vite.createServer`, where every other spec here builds with
 * `vite.build`. The two give a plugin different `PluginContext`s, and the half that matters now is what Vite
 * does with a specifier the plugin refuses to resolve: a build emits the bare name into the chunk, while a
 * dev server runs `vite:import-analysis` over the served module and rewrites, or rejects, what it can reach.
 * An external that survived the build and not the dev server would be a pack whose frontend loads from
 * `dist` and 500s under `apack dev`.
 *
 * The ceiling of this path, worth knowing before reading a result here: the app imports the pack's entry
 * through `pack://`, outside Vite's module graph, so an edit is a `page reload` and never a component
 * update — no importer is in the graph to accept one. A pack whose source is on this disk is served from
 * the renderer's own graph instead, which is what `dev-pack-hmr.integration.spec.ts` holds.
 *
 * In the expensive half because it stands a real Vite dev server up.
