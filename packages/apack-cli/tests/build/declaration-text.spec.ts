// `sortLiteralUnions` is what makes a pack's declaration bundles reproducible, and until this spec existed
// nothing guarded it: the only thing that would have noticed its removal is `npm run check:repro`, which is
// provisional and has no caller. Removing the sort was measured on 2026-09-28 to bring back three distinct
// hashes in four builds of `action-defs.d.ts`, so what is asserted here is the difference between a build
// output that is reproducible and one that is not.
