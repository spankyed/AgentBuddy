/**
 * Exit quietly when whatever is reading our stdout goes away.
 *
 * `apack profiles | head` closes the pipe under the writer, and an unhandled EPIPE crashes with a stack
 * trace that reads like a failure of the command. Every command could always hit this; none did, because
 * none printed more than fits the pipe buffer before the reader exits — `apack profiles` is the first
 * with a table long enough, which is how it was found.
 *
 * Only EPIPE: attaching a listener at all stops Node throwing on any stdout error, so anything else would
 * be swallowed silently, which is worse than the crash this prevents. `process.exit` is right here and
 * almost nowhere else — stdout is already closed, so there is nothing left to flush.
 *
 * `scripts/lib/exit-on-epipe.ts` is the same five lines for the repo's own orchestrators. Not imported:
 * `check:specifiers` refuses a package reaching into `scripts/`, because a module there belongs to no
 * package and `npm run spec` could not route a change to it back to anything that covers it.
