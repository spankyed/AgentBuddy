/**
 * The downloaded Beta builds, which nothing has ever reclaimed — each one an unpacked app of a few hundred
 * megabytes, and they accumulate one per release tested against.
 *
 * **The newest is kept by default, because resolution prefers a cached build.** `cachedBetaApp`
 * (`pack-host.ts`) answers from the cache whenever a downloaded build satisfies the pack's range, so
 * emptying it on a plain `clean` would turn every later run into a download. `--all` is for when that is
 * what you want — moving to a newer Beta is deleting the one you have.
 *
 * Staging directories go whatever the flag says: a download that was killed leaves one, nothing reads it
 * again, and `cachedBetaBuilds` already refuses to see it.
 *
 * `dirs` is a parameter rather than a `cliDirs()` this reads for itself, and the difference is the test:
 * this deletes from a cache a person owns, so the policy — which build survives — is checked against a
 * temporary one rather than trusted. `clean` passes nothing.
