 * the wrong answer twice over: the browser resolves it against the module's own `pack://` URL, so the
 * request comes back to *this* server, which left the specifier external and has nothing to serve for it. The
 * pack's frontend then fails to load, where leaving the name alone resolves it through the document's import
 * map to the host's module. A build has no such rewrite and emits the bare name already, so this is what
 * makes `apack dev` agree with `apack build`.
 *
 * **It has to be a middleware, not a `transform`.** Vite appends `importAnalysisPlugin` after the user's
 * `post` plugins, so no hook runs after the rewrite; the only place left is the response. That is also the
 * path that matters — the `pack://` handler proxies an HTTP request here
 * (`packages/main/src/modules/pack-protocol/PackProtocol.ts`), so what the browser links against is this
 * body, not a `transformRequest` result.
 *
