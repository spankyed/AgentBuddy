// What a pack's code may say, as rules any pack is held to — not only the ones in this repo.
//
// Before this, an external pack got two of the nineteen rules that keep this repo's packs honest
// (`docs/goals/goal-one-rule-set.md`): the other seventeen lived in `scripts/check-import-specifiers.ts`,
// which only ever runs here. The rule is the same rule wherever it runs, so it lives once — here, in the
// package that drives a pack's whole toolchain — and the repo's script applies these same functions to the
// packs in this checkout while keeping its own rules about the repo's layout.
//
// **A rule is switchable only when a violation has no runtime effect.** `host-imports` is not: the bundler
// refuses the import anyway, and the message is the point. `backend-console` is: `console.log` logs. The
// switchable ones are named in `apack.checks.json`'s `allow` list, which is read at build time and never by
// the app, so `apack.json` stays what the app loads.

 * running nine rules cost about what running one used to.
 *
 * **One offence, one message.** Several rules can be right about one line —
 * `import { _rootEvents } from '@apack/host/bus'` breaks three — and a pack author deleting one import should
 * be told once, by the rule whose cause comes first: the package is not installed for a pack, so whether the
 * name is `@internal` and whether it is the raw transport are beside the point. So a finding whose span sits
 * inside one an earlier rule already claimed is dropped, and `PACK_RULES`' order *is* that precedence —
 * declared there, with each rule's reason, rather than decided here.
 *
 * Spans, not lines: two real offences do share a line (`import …; console.log(…)`), and both should be
 * reported. `pack-rules.spec.ts` holds the order to what it claims.
