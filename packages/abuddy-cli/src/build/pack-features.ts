 *
 * **Not transitive reach**, deliberately. Twelve of default-setup's sixteen generated modules reach a contract
 * through some hop — `repository` does, through a feature's repository index — and a module the leaf reaches is
 * meant to use the repository facade, which the case beside this rule's asserts. What sets these five apart is that

/**
 * `file:line: specifier` for each import a contract leaf makes that would put the machine back in front of codegen.
 *
 * A leaf is a module `abuddy.json` names at `features[].plugin.contract` or `features[].system.contract`, and
 * codegen reads the contract from it as a declared type — without resolving the actor it describes. Both actors
 * import `#generated/events`, and `#generated/events` imports both contracts, so reading a contract anywhere its
 * actor is reachable closes that loop again. The two sides are one rule with one machine module each: `fe/state`
 * for a plugin, `be/system` for a system.
 *
 * So a leaf imports neither machine, no other feature, and nothing generated but `types` and `ears`, which are
 * themselves leaves: a context needs both (`NoteDTO`, `EARS.EntityId`) and neither reaches `#generated/events`.
 * Those two are for the types a contract's state and its events' payload *fields* name, and no further: what
 * codegen reads out of a contract — an event's `type` literal and the union it sits in — may never come from
 * generated code, which codegen writes after reading every contract, so a pack that names one there never builds
 * (`abuddy-sdk`'s `module-exports.ts` says so in the failure).
 *
 * The cycle is one of two reasons, and the other is cost, recorded at `generate-entries.ts:433`: the contracts are
 * in codegen's TypeScript program and the machines are not, so an import that puts one back in reach parses and
 * binds every machine and its whole closure, XState and Vue included, for nothing.
 *
 * **Two harms, and which one a contract gets depends on where the machine's type resolves from.** Measured
 * 2026-09-27 on the external-pack fixture, five mutations, each from a cold tree (`rm -rf src/__generated__`):
 *
 * - A contract's `state` or `context` from the machine, and an `incoming` as `Extract<>` over the machine's event
 *   union, **build with exit 0** and a byte-identical `src/__generated__/events.ts` — nothing reads those
 *   positions. So does a plugin `inbox` naming a plain union the machine module happens to declare.
 *   What moves is the published facade: `dist/types/pack-types.d.ts` grew by 41 lines, gaining `import * as xstate
 *   from 'xstate'` and the machine's whole declaration, every action name included, where a contract of its own
 *   contributes one interface — and a dependent's facade inlines its dependencies' verbatim, so it travels a hop
 *   further. Not a *disallowed* import: `abuddy-cli`'s `build/facade-gate.ts` allows `xstate` and `zod`, which
 *   every dependent has. The harm is size and coupling.
 * - A read position — the plugin's `inbox`, the system's `outgoing` — resolving *through the machine's own type
 *   parameters* **refuses, every time**. `EventFromLogic<typeof theMachine>` passes through
 *   `defineSystem<Contract>()` and so back through the contract, which collapses it to `any`, and codegen refuses
 *   an `any` there. It never comes right: the throw means the generated module it needed is never written, so the
 *   next run starts from the same tree.
 *
 * That is why the rule is not switchable and why an external pack needs it: one shape breaks the build for good,
 * the other ships the machine to every dependent, and nothing else tells the author either.
 *
 * Not a *disallowed* import, though, and that is worth knowing before deriving it again: `abuddy-cli`'s
 * `build/facade-gate.ts` allows a facade to import `@abuddy/*`, Node built-ins and `@abuddy/sdk`'s peers, `xstate`
 * and `zod` among them, because every dependent has them. The leak is size and coupling, not resolution.
 *
 * **Codegen's own refusal is not a second guard for this.** `checkResolved`
 * (`abuddy-sdk/src/build/module-exports.ts`) refuses a type that collapsed to `any` in the four positions a reader
 * reads — the contract, `outgoing`, `inbox`, and each member of an event union — and reads a collapse in `state`,
 * `context` or an event's payload as data. It has to: `src/__generated__/` is untracked and codegen computes every
 * generated file before its caller writes any of them, so on a pack's first build nothing under `#generated/`
 * resolves and those positions are legitimately `any` (`actions/fe/contract.ts` has two). So of the claims below,
 * only the closure's reach to `#generated/events` overlaps that refusal, and only where the collapse lands in one
 * of the four; the rest have no other guard in any tree.
