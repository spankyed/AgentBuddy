/**
 * Where a pack's own compiler resolves the `@abuddy` packages: their published `dist`, or a checkout's source.
 *
 * A pack compiles against `dist` — the one layout a pack author ever has — and both of its bundlers do so
 * unconditionally: `bundlePackSource` hands esbuild the pack's tsconfig, and esbuild reads `baseUrl`, `paths` and
 * `experimentalDecorators` from one but has no notion of `customConditions` at all (measured: the string does not
 * appear in its binary); the FE bundler names Vite's default client conditions outright. `tsc` is the odd one out,
 * because it *does* honour `customConditions`. So a pack linked to a checkout that enables `@abuddy/source`
 * typechecks green against workspace source while shipping bundles built from `dist`: the typecheck proved
 * nothing, and the author finds out after publishing.
 *
 * **It resolves rather than reading config.** The repo's own `findMissingSourceConditions` reads configs, and has
 * to: it asks a different question — whether a *config* declares the condition, which covers a pack's vitest or
 * Vite config, where no module resolution happens under `tsc` at all. This one asks what the compiler actually
 * does, which catches every route to source (an `extends` chain, a `paths` entry, a project reference), needs no
 * config text parsed, and can name the file it landed on.
 *
 * `assertSourceResolution` (`@abuddy/host/build/source-resolution`) is the same question with the opposite
 * expectation, asked of a host process. It lives in `@abuddy/host` and this does not, because this needs
 * `typescript`, which `@abuddy/host` deliberately does not declare — `packages/api` imports host, and the
 * compiler has no business in the backend's tree.

 * already passed against workspace source. The repo's own `findMissingSourceConditions` reads configs for the
 * same reason. What it cannot be is `definePackTestConfig`'s job — that helper *builds* a config and never sees
 * one, so a pack spreading its result and adding `resolve.conditions` is invisible to it.
 *
 * A string literal from the syntax tree, not a text search, so a comment about the condition is not a finding
 * and a pack may still write about it. Any literal, rather than only one inside `resolve.conditions`: there is
 * no other reason for a pack's config to name it, and matching the shape would mean guessing at how the
 * property was spelled.
 *
 * A pattern over the pack root rather than a list of filenames, so `vitest.config.js`, a `.mjs` and a
 * `vitest.workspace.ts` are covered — a list of four `.ts` spellings left every JS config unchecked, which is
 * not the shape an external pack is obliged to use. `readSource` reads all of them: `pack-sources.ts`'s
 * `SOURCE_FILE` covers `js|jsx|mjs|cjs`, and a non-`.vue` file is parsed whole.
