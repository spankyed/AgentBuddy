Usage: abuddy add migration [version] [options]

Options:
  --version <version>    Target version (default: this pack's version)
  --app                  Target AgentBuddy's version line instead of this pack's

A migration's version line says what its target is a version of. By default that is this pack's own
\`version\`, which is what moves when the pack does. --app puts it on AgentBuddy's release line, for data
whose shape follows the app rather than the pack. Either way a target is a release — three numbers — and a
prerelease is normalised to the release it belongs to.

Example:
  abuddy add migration 0.2.0
  abuddy add migration --version 0.2.0
  abuddy add migration 0.3.16 --app

  // The pack's own line is the default, since a pack's data usually moves when the pack does — and because

  const line: MigrationLine = hasFlag(args, '--app') ? 'app' : 'pack';
  // The positional is the first argument that is not a flag, so `add migration --app` falls through to the
  // manifest's version. Reading `args[0]` instead takes `--app` as the version it targets, and the
  // normalisation below strips from the first `-`: the manifest gains a key of `""` naming a file called
  // `.ts`, and the only thing that objects is the next command to read the manifest
  const positional = args.find((arg) => !arg.startsWith('-'));
  const asked = parseFlag(args, '--version') || positional || manifest.version || '0.0.0';
  // A migration targets a *release*, on either line: the manifest key is three numbers and nothing else, and
  // the app's runner reads a prerelease as its release (`0.3.15-beta.2` runs the `0.3.15` migrations), so a
  // prerelease target is one nothing would ever match. The default is the manifest's version, which during
  // a beta is a prerelease, so it is normalised rather than refused
  const version = asked.replace(/[-+].*$/, '');
  // Checked before anything is written. The manifest's schema holds the same rule and is the backstop, but
  // it speaks on the next read of the manifest — too late to stop this command writing the entry and an
  // empty module and reporting that it worked

  // The manifest entry first: it is the declaration, its key is the version the migration targets and the
  // map it goes in is the line that version is on, so a file no manifest names runs never. It refuses a
