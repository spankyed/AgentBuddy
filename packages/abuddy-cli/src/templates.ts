// The scaffold's output, as files. `abuddy init` and `abuddy add` write pack code, and pack code in a
// template literal is code no rule can read: it needed a masker that blanked `${…}` in place, an
// extension-only specifier check with no pack to resolve against, and a rule whose whole job was to check
// that the list of files holding such literals was complete (`goal-one-rule-set.md`). As files under
// `templates/`, they are ordinary pack code — every rule reads them, an author can read them, and a `${…}`
// they must emit needs no escaping.
//
// The tree under `templates/pack/` mirrors a scaffolded pack, which is load-bearing rather than tidy: a
// template's relative specifiers then resolve against real sibling files, so the own-module rule checks them
// for real instead of by looking at extensions.
// **Six of the scaffold's outputs are not template files, each for a reason that is not style:**
//
// - `MANIFEST_TEMPLATE` and `PACKAGE_JSON_TEMPLATE` are objects with computed keys and runtime-resolved version
//   ranges, `JSON.stringify`d. As files they would be JSON with placeholders in key position — not valid JSON,
//   and no rule here reads JSON anyway.
// - `PACK_TSCONFIG` is imported *as an object* by `tests/_support/pack-builds.ts`, which spreads its
//   `compilerOptions` to add a condition.
// - `ENV_DTS_TEMPLATE` is a `.d.ts`, and electron-builder strips every `.d.ts` from the packaged app whatever
//   its `files` array says — measured on a `--dir` build: zero remain in app.asar.
// - `EXAMPLE_CONTENT_TEMPLATE` is markdown, and the same file list excludes `'!**/*.md'`.
// - `GITIGNORE_TEMPLATE` would be a `templates/pack/.gitignore`, which npm reads as ignore rules for that
//   subtree when packing — silently dropping template files.
//
// The register-array entries and import lines `add/{block,artifact,migration}.ts` build are not templates
// either: they edit a file that is already there, through `updateRegisterArray`.

/**
 * A placeholder: `__UPPER_SNAKE__`.
 *
 * It holds no `$`, `{` or `}`, so every `${…}` a template must emit — a step's `` `__LABEL__ ${index}` ``, a
 * workflow's `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` — is literal text needing no escape, which is exactly what the
 * template literals this replaced could not do. And `__FOO__` is a legal identifier, object key, attribute
 * and part of a longer name (`DSL__PASCAL__Node`), so a template still parses as TypeScript and as an SFC.
 *
 * Two rules come with it. A placeholder never occupies a statement slot: it would stop the file parsing, and
 * then the rules that read it silently pass. Multi-statement variation is a second template file instead
 * (`smoke.spec.ts` and `smoke-without-plugin.spec.ts`). And there is no escape for a literal `__UPPER__` —
 * nothing needs one, and `renderTemplate` throws rather than emitting one by accident.
