// `abuddy facade-report` over a real pack: what its subject is.
//
// The command re-takes the facade — codegen, then the same `bundlePackTypes` the build runs — rather than
// reading `dist/types/pack-types.d.ts`, so the report is held against what the pack's sources describe now.
// Two cases here are what that is worth and would fail against a command that read the built file: junk
// written over the bundle does not move the verdict, and the check runs with no `dist` at all.
//
// The normalisation those reports go through is `tests/build/facade-report.spec.ts`, over text, because a pack
// cannot be asked to emit its declarations in the wrong order on purpose.
//
// **One pack, built once, and the cases run in declaration order**: each states the premise the one before it
// leaves, which is what keeps this to a single build rather than eight.
