/**
 * One build of a pack at a time (`src/build/build-lock.ts`).
 *
 * Two builds of one pack stage into the same directory and each clears it as its first act, so without this
 * the second wipes the first's half-written tree and both rename something over `dist`. Nothing else excluded
 * them: `holdChainLock` keeps one chain run per checkout and `withBuildLock` one build of the five `@abuddy`
 * packages, and a pack's own build sat between the two.
 *
 * The mechanism — the take, the takeover of a dead holder's lock, the release on four interrupts, the bounded
 * retry — is `@abuddy/host/exclusive-lock`'s, covered from above by `abuddy-host/tests/database/write-lock.spec.ts`
 * with real processes. What is asked here is this caller's policy: where the file sits, that it waits, what it
 * says when the wait runs out, and that the wait is not a wait on itself.
