 * @abuddy/ui's components are Tailwind class names, and some name colours that exist only where a
 * Tailwind config defines them. Inside the app they resolve; a pack that sets `fe.bundleUi` runs its
 * own Tailwind build over its own config, so without the package's preset those classes matched
 * nothing and Tailwind emitted no CSS — the component rendered with its accent missing and nothing
 * said so. The preset travels with the components to close that.
 *
 * Two things have to hold, and the first is the one that rots: the preset has to keep covering what
 * the components actually use. A new `primary-800` in a template would compile, render and ship with
 * no styling, exactly as before.
