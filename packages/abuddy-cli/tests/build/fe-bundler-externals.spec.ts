/**
 * **What a pack's frontend bundle leaves to the host, which is how the two share one instance of a module.**
 *
 * A pack must use *this app's* Vue, SDK and UI kit: two copies of Vue are two reactivity systems and a
 * component that never updates, two copies of the SDK a second, empty registry. The bundle achieves that by
 * *not* resolving those specifiers — it emits the bare name, and the document's import map resolves it to
 * the host's module (`hostSharedModulesPlugin`, `packages/renderer/vite.config.ts`).
 *
 * So the claim here is about resolution, and it is the one the mechanism rests on. It replaces 69 cases that
 * compared a generated proxy's export names against the module's real ones: those policed one mechanism
 * against the other, and with the proxies gone there is no second list to disagree.
 *
 * The case that would catch this going wrong is the third — every specifier the bundle leaves bare is one
 * the host's map names. A specifier left bare that the host does not serve is a frontend that does not load.
