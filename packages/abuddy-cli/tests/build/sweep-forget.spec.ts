/**
 * `freshnessSweep`'s `forget`: beside `package-freshness.spec.ts`, which covers the rest of the same module.
 *
 * It was in `@app/repo-checks` while it also held the chain's one transient writer to its mutex. Nothing
 * writes transiently now (`conflictsOf`'s comment says what that would need), and what is left is a claim
 * about a host function — so it sits where that function's other spec does, which is also where
 * `npm run spec` routes a change to it.
 *
 * The chain's dispatch decisions share one reading of the tree, and `forget` is the whole reason they can.
 *
 * A shared reading answers as of its first look, so a step whose inputs another step has just written would
 * be called fresh and skipped — work silently not done, reported green. What makes it sound is that the
 * writer is always known: every step declares what it writes, the chain forgets exactly those paths as each
 * step finishes, and the next decision re-reads them.
 *
 * So what has to hold is that `forget` actually forgets — by prefix, since what is memoised are the files
 * under a declared directory and the listing of it, not the directory key. Every write the chain has is a
 * declared product, and a reader of one is ordered after its writer by `dependsOn`, derived from that same
 * declaration; nothing writes transiently where another step reads (`conflictsOf`'s comment has what that
 * would need).
