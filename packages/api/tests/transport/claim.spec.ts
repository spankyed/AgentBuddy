// When a claimed name is given back.
//
// A name claimed on a connection has to be released by something, and which something is the whole content of
// this file. It was the subscription's teardown first, which is wrong twice over: a client that stopped
// subscribing but kept its socket lost a name it was still using, and a client that claimed without ever
// subscribing kept the name until the API process exited — so the next drive session was refused with nothing
// left for its user to close.
//
// The connection ending is the only event that means the claimer is gone, and the adapter gives it to
// `createContext` as an abort signal (it aborts from `client.once('close')`, verified in
// `node_modules/@trpc/server/dist/ws-*.mjs`). These cases pin that, because the failure is invisible: a leaked
// claim looks like nothing at all until the session after next.
