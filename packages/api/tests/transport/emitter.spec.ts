// A log line must never cost the caller, or the event.
//
// `appendAppEventLog` runs inside `emitLog`, *before* its own `emit`, so a throw there took three things at
// once: the line, the event reaching the console printer and the logs system, and the caller that logged it. A
// BigInt was enough to do it — `reportError`'s step path hands this `redactSecrets` output, which passes one
// through untouched, and a bare `JSON.stringify` refuses it.
//
// What these cases cover is the serialising, which is the half that was broken. The other half, a write that
// fails, is `appendCappedLine`'s and is covered where it lives — a case here could not fail, which a mutation
// showed: with the appender's own swallow in place, nothing this file does can make the write throw.
