// The context is one connection's identity, and two things have to hold: it is different per connection, and
// the signal it carries actually arrives and fires when the socket closes.
//
// The first is checked by calling `createContext` directly. The second cannot be — handing it a signal and
// then asserting the signal is there proves nothing about the adapter, which is the only thing that supplies
// one in production. So the last case runs a real `applyWSSHandler` over a real socket with this module's own
// `createContext`, for `encoder.spec.ts`'s reason: the failure is silent. Every participant claim is released
// from `ctx.closed` (`bus.ts`), so a tRPC bump that stopped passing `info.signal` would leak every claim for
// the life of the process and no unit test would notice.

/**
 * What the adapter hands `createContext`, asserted through the adapter.
 *
 * The router is a local one so nothing boots — what is under test is the seam, not the app. The procedure
 * reports the context it was given and arms a listener on it, so one call answers all three halves: the signal
 * is there, it has *not* fired while the connection is open, and it fires once the socket closes.
 *
 * **The middle one is what says this is the connection's signal and not an operation's**, which is the whole
 * reason `info.signal` may be required — the adapter keeps two controllers, one per connection and one per
 * call, and `ctx.closed` must be the first. It is settled *causally* rather than by elapsed time: the case ends
 * a whole operation, by starting a subscription and stopping it, and the `stopped` frame coming back is the
 * evidence that it ended. The connection is still open at that point, so a per-call signal would have aborted
 * and this one must not have.
 *
 * Nothing here waits for a duration — each step awaits the frame that says it happened, and the only number is
 * a deadline that never runs when the code works. What that leaves unguarded is a signal with no relationship
 * to anything, such as a stray timer; ruling that out would take waiting a while and finding nothing, which is
 * the duration-shaped assertion these cases exist to avoid.
