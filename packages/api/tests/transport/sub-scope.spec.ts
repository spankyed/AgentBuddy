// How far an outgoing message reaches, which is the one thing `bus.sub` decides.
//
// Two subscriptions are two windows. A message with no `client` is for both of them — that is what a notification
// is, and what every backend send was before a return address existed. A message naming a connection is an answer
// to something that connection asked, and must reach only it.
//
// The renderer's half of the reach question is `send-scope.spec.ts` (`@abuddy/host`), which pins that a backend
// send arrives in every window and an in-window send crosses none. It cannot cover this one: it has no API, and
// it simulates the bus by calling each window's client directly. The filter is server-side on purpose, so the
// window never sees a message that was not for it, and this is where that is checked.
