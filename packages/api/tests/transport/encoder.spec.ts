// A value the app cannot serialise must not end a client's event stream.

// **Why this runs a real server instead of calling the encoder directly.** The encoder's own behaviour is the
// easy half; what this file is for is the half that can go wrong silently. `experimental_encoder` is named
// experimental, so a tRPC bump could rename or drop it, and the symptom would be the original bug back again —
// one BigInt and the subscription is dead — with every unit test of the encoder still green. So each case here
// goes through `applyWSSHandler` over a real socket: if the option stops being honoured, these fail.
//
// The router is a local one rather than the app's, so nothing boots. What is under test is the adapter's
// serialisation seam, which that local router exercises exactly as `appRouter` would.
