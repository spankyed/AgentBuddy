/**
 * Whether `ref` names something a reply could reach: a registered system, a registered plugin, or a name a
 * connection claimed. The symmetric check to the one `receiveClientEvent` makes on `to` — without it a stale or
 * misspelled `sender` becomes an answer the bus drops into a diagnostic, one step removed from the send that
 * caused it.
 *
 * The two maps rather than `systemIds()`/`pluginIds()`, which spread a cached map's keys into a new array on
 * every call: most of a window's sends carry a `sender`, so this runs on the common path and a lookup there
 * should cost nothing. The third clause is the one the drive engine lives on — `host/drive` is claimed, never
 * registered, so it appears in neither map.

    // `client` is omitted on purpose, and is the one field that must stay omitted: it is stamped from the
    // connection below rather than accepted, so a sender cannot claim another connection's address. The server
    // knows it for free, so taking it from the wire would be strictly worse for no gain.
    //
    // `sender` is named, and that is not the same decision. It is where an answer goes, and a client has to be
    // able to say — a window knows which of its plugins asked, and a participant which name it claimed.
    //
    // **It is checked for existence and not for identity, and the difference is worth knowing.** A `sender` must
    // name something addressable, the way `to` must; what it cannot do is prove the caller *is* that thing. One
    // window could name another's plugin, and the bound on that is `client`: a reply goes to the connection the
    // ask arrived on, so the worst a forged `sender` buys is making a system answer *you* while believing it
    // answered somebody else. That is a bug rather than an escalation only while every caller is trusted, which
    // today means every caller holds the API token and no pack exists outside this repo — a premise the root
    // CLAUDE.md gives an expiry for. Closing it properly needs per-connection knowledge of which plugins a
    // window actually loaded, which `packClientReady` does not keep.
