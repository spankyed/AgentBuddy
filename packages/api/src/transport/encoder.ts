// How a tRPC message is put on the wire, and why `JSON.stringify` alone is not enough.
//
// **The failure this exists for.** The ws adapter's default encoder is `JSON.stringify(data)`, and it is called
// from the async loop that drains a subscription, not from the `emit.next` that fed it. So a value it cannot
// serialise does not fail the one send: it throws inside the adapter, the subscription dies, the renderer's
// client reports `onFailed`, and the shell goes to `BACKEND_ERROR` — the fatal error page. One event carrying
// one bad value ends that window's entire event stream, and every later request times out while `/eval` and
// `/state` keep answering, so it reads as a database fault rather than a serialisation one.
//
// What `JSON.stringify` does with the awkward cases:
//
// | value | `JSON.stringify` |
// |---|---|
// | `BigInt`, anywhere — including a field of a class instance | **throws** `TypeError` |
// | a circular structure | **throws** `TypeError` |
// | a function, a symbol, `undefined` | silently omitted |
// | a `Map`, a `Set`, a class instance with no BigInt | `{}`, or its own enumerable fields |
//
// A BigInt has an obvious answer, its decimal string, and a replacer reaches every one however deep. A cycle
// has none — `JSON.stringify` throws on one whatever the replacer says — so it takes a second pass that cuts
// the loop. And since that pass reads properties itself, it can fail too, which is why there is a third tier:
// **this function must never throw**, because a throw from it reaches that drain loop.
//
// **Fast path first, because this runs per streamed token**: the ordinary case costs one `JSON.stringify`, the
// replacer being the same single pass, and the walk happens only after a throw.
//
// The replacer is therefore an optimisation rather than the mechanism: `withoutCycles` stringifies BigInts too,
// so deleting it changes no output byte and merely routes every BigInt message through a throw and a full walk.
// The only case that can tell the two apart is the one asserting a BigInt is sent *without* a warning.
