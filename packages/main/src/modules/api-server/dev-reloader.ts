/**
 * Restarts the API when its bundle is rebuilt, so a host, SDK or API edit costs a reload rather than a
 * manual build and a restarted app.
 *
 * `npm start` leaves `tsup --watch` on the bundle; an edit to `packages/api/src`, `@abuddy/host/src` or
 * `@abuddy/sdk/src` rewrites `dist/server.js`, and this asks `ApiServer` to replace the child. Measured
 * 2026-10-10: ~95ms to rebuild, 545ms for the API to come back ready. The window never closes.
 *
 * **The bundle is the trigger because nothing else can be.** Main owns the API child, so the restart has
 * to happen here, and nothing outside an Electron window can reach main — no socket, port or IPC. A write
 * is also the honest signal: it says the thing that would be loaded has changed.
