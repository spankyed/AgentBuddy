// **Why this package has a suite at all.** It is the narrowest layer in the repo and the only one a

// here is reachable by code the app did not write. The three claims below are the ones nothing else holds:
// where the API token comes from, that a port argument is a port, and that every subscription can be
// undone. Everything else about this module is a list of channels, which `CLAUDE.md` tables and a spec
// could only restate.
